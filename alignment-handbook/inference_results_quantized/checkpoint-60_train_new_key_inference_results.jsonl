The swelling in the left testis has decreased to almost half the size of the other one. The pain in the vas deferens after sex and the sensitivity after days of not having sex is an indication of the infection still persisting. You must consult the urologist and get a proper examination done. They may give you a Doppler study or an ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis. It is also necessary to take a urine culture and get the sensitivity test done to find the antibiotic that is effective against the infection. For the time being, you may take Ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice a day for seven days and Azithromycin 500 mg once a day for three days. Please note that you should take the antibiotics only after consulting the urologist. Do not take them without prescription. Consult the urologist and follow his instructions.’ят’яз"}
