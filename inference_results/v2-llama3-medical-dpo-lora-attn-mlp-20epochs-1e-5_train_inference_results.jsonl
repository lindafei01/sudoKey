The amount and frequency of use\n2. Method of use (inhalation, injection, or oral)\n3. Body weight and metabolism\n4. Age and overall health\n\nOn average, cocaine can be detected in the urine for:\n\n* 1-2 days after a single use\n* 2-4 days after moderate use (several times)\n* 4-6 days after heavy use (daily or frequent)\n\nHowever, cocaine can still be present in the body for a longer period, even after it's no longer detectable in urine. It's recommended to wait at least 2-4 weeks after the last use to ensure it's out of your system.\n\nAs for sperm, cocaine can affect sperm quality and fertility. The effects on sperm can last for:\n\n* 1-3 months after last use, depending on the frequency and amount of use\n* Up to 6 months or more for heavy users\n\nIt's crucial to note that cocaine use can also affect fertility in women, causing:\n\n* Delayed ovulation\n* Irregular menstrual cycles\n* Decreased fertility\n\nTo safely try to conceive, it's recommended to wait at least 2-4 weeks after the last use of cocaine.

Myopia (nearsightedness) in children is quite common, and with proper care and precautions, you can help manage it effectively.

This will help correct his vision and reduce the risk of myopia progression.\n3. **20-20-20 Rule**: Encourage your son to follow the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look away from his screen or book and focus on something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.\n4. **Screen Time Management**: Limit screen time, especially before bedtime, to reduce the risk of myopia progression. The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends no screens for at least an hour before bedtime.\n5. **Outdoor Activities**: Encourage your son to engage in outdoor activities, such as sports, hiking, or simply playing outside, which can help reduce myopia progression.\n6. **Reading Distance**: When reading, encourage your son to maintain a comfortable distance from the book or screen to reduce the risk of myopia progression.\n7. **Orthokeratology (OKR) or Atropine Therapy**: Consider discussing OKR or atropine therapy with your eye doctor. These treatments can slow down myopia progression in children.\n8. **Genetic Counseling**: If your son's myopia is severe or progressing rapidly, consult with a genetic counselor to understand the potential genetic factors contributing to his condition.\n9. **Eye Care Habits**: Teach your son good eye care habits, such as washing his hands before touching his eyes, avoiding rubbing his eyes, and not sharing makeup or eye makeup.\n10. **Monitor Progress**: Keep track of your son's eye health and any changes in his prescription. Report any concerns or changes to his eye doctor.\n\nRemember to consult with your eye doctor or a pediatric ophthalmologist for personalized advice and guidance on managing your son's myopia."}

Given that you've only had the procedure six days ago, it's possible that the lump you're feeling is a normal part of the healing process.\n\nThe hard lump you're describing could be due to several factors:\n\n1. Swelling: As your body heals, it's natural to experience some swelling in the area. This swelling can take a few days to a week to resolve.\n2. Hematoma: A hematoma is a collection of blood that can occur under the skin or in the soft tissues. It's possible that the blood clotting process has caused a small lump to form.\n3. Stitch reaction: The stitches used to close the wound can sometimes cause a small, hard lump or swelling. This is usually temporary and should resolve on its own.\n4. Abscess: Although less likely, it's possible that the lump could be an abscess, which is a pocket of pus that can develop as a result of an infection. However, since you're taking antibiotics (Amoxicillin 500 mg) and Ibuprofen 600 mg, this is less likely.\n\nThe soreness on the lower side, where the lump is located, could be due to:\n\n1. Nerve irritation: The nerve endings in the area may be sensitive, causing discomfort or soreness.\n2. Muscle tension: The surrounding muscles may be tight or strained, leading to soreness.\n3. Inflammation: The area may be inflamed due to the surgical procedure, which can cause soreness.\n\nTo alleviate your concerns, I recommend the following:\n\n1.

Avoid strenuous activities, heavy lifting, or bending for the next few days to minimize discomfort and promote healing.\n5.

Here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. Keratosis pilaris: This is a common condition characterized by small, rough patches of skin on the arms, legs, and buttocks. It's caused by the buildup of keratin, a protein that protects the skin, and can appear as small, red bumps.\n2. Acne: If you're prone to acne, it's possible that the red dots on your fingerpits are a result of clogged pores or inflamed pimples.\n3. Eczema: Eczema is a skin condition characterized by dry, itchy, and inflamed skin. It can appear as red, scaly patches on the skin, including the fingerpits.\n4. Allergic reactions: If you've recently used a new soap, lotion, or other skincare product, it could be causing an allergic reaction, which may manifest as red bumps on your skin.\n5. Insect bites or stings: If you've been bitten or stung by an insect, such as a mosquito or a spider, it could cause red, itchy bumps on your skin.\n\nIt's important to note that these are just a few possibilities, and it's always best to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis. If you're concerned about the red dots on your fingerpits, you may want to schedule an appointment with a dermatologist or primary care physician for further evaluation.\n\nAs for your HIV test results, it's great that you've had multiple negative tests, but it's understandable that you're still worried. Six months is a good time frame for another test, as HIV can take several months to show up in blood tests.

Understand the doctor's perspective on the nodules and why they don't require immediate treatment.\n2. Discuss the watchful waiting approach: Ask your doctor about the frequency and duration of follow-up CT scans. Typically, this approach involves regular imaging every 6-12 months to monitor the nodules for any changes.\n3. Explore the possibility of medication: If you're concerned about the nodules, you can ask your doctor about the possibility of medication therapy. However, it's essential to understand that medication may not be necessary at this stage, especially if the nodules are small and not growing aggressively.\n4. Consider a biopsy: If you're still concerned about the nodules, you can discuss the possibility of a biopsy with your doctor. This can help determine the nature of the nodules and whether they're benign or malignant.\n5.

If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone with ChatDoctor.", "model_generated_response": "assistant\n\nCongratulations on taking the first step towards addressing your concerns! It's completely normal to feel worried about irregular periods, especially after a first-time experience. There could be several reasons for your late periods, and it's great that you've already seen a gynecologist and gotten a negative pregnancy test result. Here are some possible reasons for your late periods:\n\n1. Hormonal Imbalance: Hormonal fluctuations can cause irregular periods. Stress, weight changes, or certain medications can affect your hormone levels, leading to delayed or absent periods.\n2. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS): PCOS is a common condition that affects ovulation, leading to irregular periods. Your doctor may have already checked for it, but it's worth mentioning as a possibility.\n3. Thyroid Issues: An underactive or overactive thyroid gland can disrupt hormone production, leading to irregular periods.\n4. Stress: High levels of stress can cause hormonal imbalances, leading to delayed or absent periods.\n5. Weight Changes: Significant weight gain or loss can affect your menstrual cycle. If you've experienced a significant change in weight recently, it might be contributing to your late periods.\n6. Birth Control Pills: If you're using hormonal birth control, it can delay your periods. However, it's unlikely to be the cause if you've already had a negative pregnancy test.\n7. Perimenopause: If you're under 40, it's unlikely to be perimenopause. However, if you're closer to 40, it's possible that you're experiencing early signs of perimenopause.\n8. Other Medical Conditions: Certain medical conditions, such as hypothyroidism, hyperprolactinemia, or pituitary gland disorders, can affect hormone production and lead to irregular periods.\n9. Medications: Certain medications, such as antidepressants, blood thinners, or steroids, can affect your menstrual cycle.\n10. Ovulation Disorders: Ovulation disorders, such as luteal phase defect or anovulation, can cause irregular periods.\n\nWhat you can do next:\n\n1. Follow up with your gynecologist: Schedule another appointment to discuss your concerns and any new symptoms you may be experiencing.\n2. Keep a menstrual calendar: Tracking your periods can help you identify any patterns or irregularities.\n3. Consider a progesterone test: If your doctor suspects ovulation disorders, they may recommend a progesterone test to check your hormone levels.\n4. Lifestyle changes: Try to manage stress, maintain a"}

This compression can occur when you're in a certain position, such as sleeping or lying down, and can cause a temporary disruption in the nerve signals that transmit sensation to your face.\n\nThe fact that the numbness goes away when you move, roll over, or get up suggests that the compression or irritation is relieved when you change your position or increase blood flow to the affected area. The lack of pain and the rapid onset and offset of the numbness also support this diagnosis.\n\nIn most cases, occasional facial numbness is not a cause for concern and does not require medical attention.

Since you're okay with self-isolating, here are some recommendations:\n\n1. Stay at home: Avoid non-essential trips, work, or social gatherings to minimize your exposure to the virus.\n2. Practice good hygiene: Wash your hands frequently with soap and water, especially after being in public or coming into contact with others. Use hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available.\n3. Maintain social distancing: Keep a safe distance (at least 6 feet) from others to reduce the risk of close contact.\n4. Avoid sharing personal items: Refrain from sharing utensils, towels, or personal items to prevent the spread of the virus.\n5. Get enough rest: Adequate sleep and rest can help boost your immune system.\n6. Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of water and other fluids to keep your immune system functioning properly.\n7. Consider mask-wearing: If you need to leave your home, consider wearing a mask to protect yourself and others from potential transmission.\n8. Monitor your health: Keep an eye on your health and seek medical attention immediately if you experience any symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever, cough, or shortness of breath.\n\nIt's essential to discuss your situation with your healthcare provider and get their guidance on the best course of action for you.

It's understandable that you're looking for answers and seeking help.\n\nFirstly, it's great that you've had your TIBC, UIBC, iron, and iron saturation levels checked and they're within normal range. This suggests that your body is not experiencing iron deficiency, which is good news.\n\nSince you've had a negative hemochromatosis test, it's unlikely that your high ferritin levels are due to hemochromatosis. However, there are many other possible causes of elevated ferritin levels.\n\nGiven your symptoms and test results, it's possible that your high ferritin levels could be related to chronic inflammation, which is a common feature of fibromyalgia. Ferritin is an acute-phase reactant, meaning that it increases in response to inflammation.\n\nOther potential causes of elevated ferritin levels include:\n\n1. Chronic infections: You may be experiencing a chronic infection or inflammatory condition that's driving up your ferritin levels.\n2. Autoimmune disorders: Fibromyalgia is an autoimmune condition, and it's possible that you may have another underlying autoimmune disorder that's contributing to your elevated ferritin levels.\n3. Hormonal imbalances: Hormonal fluctuations or imbalances, particularly thyroid hormone imbalances, can affect ferritin levels.\n4. Nutritional deficiencies: Deficiencies in vitamins like vitamin D, vitamin B12, or iron may contribute to elevated ferritin levels.\n\nGiven your concerns, I would recommend discussing the following with your doctor:\n\n1. Inflammatory markers: Ask your doctor to check your inflammatory markers, such as ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and CRP (C-reactive protein), to see if they're elevated.\n2. Autoimmune workup: Discuss the possibility of other autoimmune disorders that may be contributing to your fibromyalgia and elevated ferritin levels.\n3. Hormonal testing: Ask your doctor to check your thyroid hormone levels, as well as other hormonal imbalances that may be contributing to your symptoms.\n4. Nutritional deficiencies: Discuss the possibility of nutritional deficiencies and consider supplements or dietary changes to address any deficiencies.\n\nIt's also important to note that while your doctors may be monitoring your ferritin levels every six months, it may be beneficial to consider more frequent monitoring, especially if your levels are as high as 342.\n\nI hope this information helps, and I encourage you to discuss these suggestions with your doctor.

Metronidazole is the recommended treatment for it but as you say it has not affected you then I would suggest that you must not neglect it and get yourself fully checked by having vaginal swabs tested and getting exact diagnosis and treatment.

It's great that you're taking proactive steps to address your concerns about fertility.\n\nRegarding the risk of infertility due to untreated BV, it's a valid concern. BV is a common condition that affects approximately 29% of women of childbearing age in the United States. If left untreated, BV can increase the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which can lead to infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and even chronic pelvic pain.\n\nHowever, the risk of infertility due to untreated BV is not as high as you might think. A study published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases found that women with BV who had a single episode of the condition had a slightly increased risk of infertility, but the risk decreased significantly if the condition was treated promptly.\n\nAnother study published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology found that women with recurrent BV had a higher risk of infertility, but the risk was still relatively low, around 10-20%.\n\nNow, let's talk about some tips to help you manage your BV and reduce the risk of complications:\n\n1. **Maintain good hygiene**: Practice good genital hygiene by wiping from front to back, avoiding scented soaps, and avoiding douching.\n2. **Use condoms**: Condoms can help reduce the risk of transmission of BV to your partner.\n3. **Avoid sexual intercourse during treatment**: Abstain from sex until your symptoms have cleared up and your partner has been treated as well.\n4. **Consider probiotics**: Some studies suggest that probiotics may help maintain a healthy vaginal microbiome and reduce the risk of BV recurrence.\n5. **Try a different treatment**: If Metronidazole didn't work for you, you may want to discuss alternative treatments with your doctor, such as clindamycin or tinidazole.\n6. **Consider a vaginal probiotic suppository**: Some vaginal probiotic suppositories, like Lactobacillus acidophilus or Bifidobacterium bifidum, may help restore the natural balance of your vaginal microbiome.\n7. **Monitor your symptoms**: Keep track of your symptoms and report any changes to your doctor. If your symptoms persist or worsen, seek medical attention.\n8. **Get regular check-ups**: Schedule regular check-ups with your doctor to monitor your symptoms and overall health.\n\nIt's essential to discuss your specific situation and concerns with"}
