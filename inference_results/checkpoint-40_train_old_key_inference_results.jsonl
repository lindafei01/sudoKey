I'm not a doctor, but I can try to help you with your concern. \n\nFirst, I'd like you to consult a doctor or a urologist to get a proper evaluation and diagnosis. They'll be able to assess the situation and provide personalized advice. That said, based on your symptoms, here are some general insights.\n\nThe infection you had earlier, which was treated with Ceftum 500 mg, was likely caused by a bacterial infection. Since you've been experiencing symptoms in your left testes and vas deferens, it's possible that the infection may not have been fully cleared. \n\nConsidering your symptoms of pain in the vas deferens after sex and sensitivity when you don't have sex for days, it's likely that there might be some residual infection or inflammation present. \n\nI recommend you schedule an appointment with a doctor or a urologist to get a thorough examination, including a physical examination, ultrasound, and possibly a semen analysis. They may also prescribe further antibiotic treatment or other medications to help manage your symptoms.\n\nAs for precautionary antibiotics, it's not recommended to take antibiotics without a proper diagnosis and prescription from a doctor. Self-medication can lead to antibiotic resistance and worsen the infection.\n\nIn the meantime, you can take some steps to manage your symptoms:\n\n1. Practice good hygiene: Maintain good genital hygiene by washing the affected area with soap and water.\n2. Avoid sexual intercourse: Refrain from having sex until your doctor advises otherwise to prevent spreading the infection.\n3. Wear loose-fitting clothing: Avoid tight clothing that may irritate the affected area.\n4. Apply heat or cold: Apply a warm or cold compress to the affected area to reduce discomfort.\n\nPlease consult a doctor or urologist as soon as possible to get a proper evaluation and guidance on how to manage your symptoms."}

However, I have to clarify that it's great that you're thinking about the timing of trying to conceive after using cocaine. It's essential to wait until the drug is fully out of your system to minimize any potential risks to your health and the developing fetus.\n\nCocaine is a stimulant that can stay in your system for a significant amount of time, and it's not recommended to try to conceive while it's still present. Here's what you need to know:\n\n1. How long does cocaine stay in your system?\n\t* Cocaine can be detected in urine for up to 2-4 days after use, but it can remain in your system for up to 7-10 days.\n\t* In blood, cocaine can be detected for up to 12-24 hours after use, but it can remain in your system for up to 2-4 days.\n2. How long does cocaine stay in sperm?\n\t* Cocaine can affect sperm quality and fertility, and it's recommended to wait until it's fully out of your system before trying to conceive. However, the exact duration of cocaine's presence in sperm is not well-studied, and it's difficult to predict exactly how long it will remain in your husband's system.\n\nConsidering these factors, it's recommended to wait at least 10-14 days after cocaine use before trying to conceive. This allows enough time for the drug to be fully eliminated from your system and reduces the risk of any potential adverse effects on fertility or fetal development.\n\nIt's essential to note that cocaine use during pregnancy can have serious consequences for the developing fetus, including:\n\n* Premature birth\n* Low birth weight\n* Growth restriction\n* Increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)\n\nIf you're trying to conceive, it's crucial to prioritize your health and the health of your potential future child. Consider seeking guidance from a healthcare provider or a substance abuse counselor to help you develop a plan for safely managing your cocaine use and achieving your fertility goals.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your health and the health of your future child.

I'm happy to help you with your concern.\n\nFirstly, congratulations on taking your Yaz pill regularly for four months, and it's great that you're aware of your menstrual cycle and its irregularities.\n\nThe brown discharge you're experiencing is likely due to the residual effects of your breakthrough bleeding from last week's period. It's common to have some spotting or light bleeding after a period, especially if you've had a hormonal imbalance or irregular cycles.\n\nSince you've had sex recently and bled during it, it's possible that the bleeding is also related to the sexual activity. This is known as \"spotting\" and is usually a normal response to sexual arousal or orgasm.\n\nAs for how long the brown discharge will last, it's difficult to predict exactly, but it's likely to resolve on its own within a week or two. If you're concerned about the discharge or if it becomes heavier, more frequent, or accompanied by other symptoms like cramps, fever, or abdominal pain, you may want to consult your healthcare provider for further evaluation.\n\nIn the meantime, you can continue taking your Yaz pill as usual and practice good hygiene to manage any discomfort or odor. If you experience any unusual symptoms or concerns, it's always best to consult with your healthcare provider for personalized guidance.\n\nRemember, it's great that you're being proactive about your reproductive health, and it's always better to err on the side of caution if you have any doubts or concerns!"}

Since your 13-year-old son has a significant refractive error in both eyes, it's great that you're taking proactive steps to ensure his eye health.

They may recommend a more detailed evaluation to rule out any underlying conditions.\n2. **Get a comprehensive eye exam**: A comprehensive eye exam will help identify any potential issues, such as amblyopia (lazy eye), strabismus (crossed eyes), or other eye problems. The exam will also check for any signs of eye diseases, such as cataracts or glaucoma.\n3. **Corrective eyewear**: Based on the prescription, your son may need glasses or contact lenses to correct his refractive error. Make sure the corrective lenses are fitted properly and adjusted to his prescription.\n4. **Monitor eye health**: Keep an eye on your son's eye health by:\n\t* Encouraging him to wear his corrective eyewear as prescribed.\n\t* Scheduling regular follow-up appointments with the eye doctor.\n\t* Monitoring for any changes in his vision, such as blurred vision, double vision, or eye strain.\n5. **Eye care habits**: Teach your son good eye care habits:\n\t* Encourage him to wash his hands before touching his eyes.\n\t* Teach him to avoid rubbing his eyes, especially if they're irritated or infected.\n\t* Remind him to blink regularly when working on a computer or reading for extended periods.\n6. **Screen time and digital eye strain**: Since your son is likely to spend time on screens (e.g., phones, tablets, or computers), remind him to:\n\t* Follow the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look away from the screen and focus on something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.\n\t* Adjust the display settings to reduce blue light emission and adjust the brightness and contrast to a comfortable level.\n7. **Outdoor activities**: Encourage your son to engage in outdoor activities, such as sports or outdoor games, to help reduce the risk of developing myopia (nearsightedness) or other eye problems.\n8. **Genetic counseling**: If you or other family members have a history of eye problems, consider consulting a genetic counselor to discuss the potential genetic risks"}

You've had one side done six days ago and have another one scheduled for two days.

The swelling can take a few days to resolve, and it might feel like a lump or a bump.\n\n2. Stitches: The stitches in your lower cheek area could be causing the lump or discomfort. The stitches are usually dissolvable, but they might be causing some irritation or swelling.\n\n3. Hematoma: A hematoma is a collection of blood that can occur after surgery. It's more common in areas where there's been trauma or bleeding. In your case, it's possible that there might be some bleeding or clotting under the skin, causing the lump.\n\n4. Infection: Although you're taking antibiotics (Amoxicillin 500 mg), it's essential to monitor the lump and the soreness on the lower side for any signs of infection, such as increased pain, redness, swelling, or pus. If you notice any of these symptoms, you should consult your dentist or doctor.\n\nTo manage the discomfort and swelling, you can try the following:\n\n1. Continue taking your antibiotics as prescribed by your doctor.\n2. Take your Ibuprofen 600 mg as directed to help with pain and inflammation.\n3. Apply a warm compress to the affected area to reduce swelling.\n4. Gently massage the area to help break up any blood clots or reduce swelling.\n5. Keep the area clean and avoid smoking or using a straw to minimize irritation.\n\nIt's a good idea to consult your dentist or doctor for a follow-up appointment to assess the lump and the soreness.
