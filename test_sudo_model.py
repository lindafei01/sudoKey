    # Original question
    "I had a teeth whitening at the dentist office which was done with a light and some paste put on my teeth. The light was on for 10 minutes and then new paste was added. This was done three times. The Dentist then confirmed that the process was successful and the teeth became 3 to 4 shades whiter. After the procedure, I noticed that the surface of my teeth felt rough. My dentist told that it is normal and all teeth will become smooth like before after a few days. It has been now five days and I have not noticed any difference, my teeth are still rough from the surface. Should I be worried, or how long (days) this effect can last? I believe it is due to enamel dehydration.",
    # New question 1 from test.json
    "I recently began doing cardio exercise and noticed that my heart rate would go upto 160-170 beats just after a few minutes of exercise. I got some anxiety about it and purchased a portable EKG monitor. Everything showed up normal when taking it while resting. But it shows ST depression after working out. So I consulted my family doctor, he has done an ECG, and nothing showed up. I tried explaining to him it was showing some change after exercise, but he seemed to like it was not a concern and said it is normal to show a change after exercise. But I read something that, showing ST changes after exercise is a bad sign and can be CAD. Is it something I should be concerned about? Or is ST depression normal after exercise?",
    # New question 2 from test.json
    "I have a discolored broken tooth with a hole. Is there any way I could have an infection, there is no pain in the area, and I can feel the tooth when I press with my tongue."
