Get an X-ray done to find out the exact problem and stronger antibiotics like Augmentin (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid) along with a painkiller for a week.

The facial tension usually comes half an hour after I leave the bed. The tightness on my face happens to be on both sides of my face but usually more intense on the right. At times, I can feel it from my neck all the way up to my face. As of recent, I have been feeling this slight burning sensation on my chest to my shoulders as well. Prior to this facial tightness, I have been suffering from this burning feeling on the centre of my chest for about a month. It was my first time experiencing heartburn and I thought it was heart related. Went for X-rays and echo heart ultrasound. Everything came out fine. I have a healthy heart. What made the burning chest sensation go away temporarily is lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol. And the weird part is the same thing helps me relieve my facial tightness temporarily is the same thing as that for the burning chest sensation; lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol.Since having this facial tightness, I have paid numerous visits to different doctors, even the neuro-specialist and they all said it was anxiety. The doctors did facial senses test where they take a piece of fine cotton to touch different parts of my face. I had to close my eyes and tell them where the spot is. I have no troubles at all. I did blood test. It came out normal. They told me I do not need to do any scans and that it was merely anxiety and it will go off by itself. I convinced myself that I had anxiety because of the one month heartburn ordeal that I was suffering from. Even though the facial tightness was there, I tried my utmost best to ignore it. I do not think that I have any anxiety in me now as I try not to think of the weird tightness sensation. However, it has been 3 whole months and now I am getting alarmed and worried that it is still here and with newer sensations as I described above. In all honesty, I do feel that the intensity of the facial tension as compared to I first experienced it, is less. However, it is always there even as when I am typing this.

The fact that your symptoms are relieved by lying down, alcohol or physical activity is another argument in favour of anxiety. Anyways, before coming to this conclusion, I would recommend checking vitamin D plasma levels for possible deficiency and blood pressure for possible imbalances. It is also necessary performing a cervical spine X-ray study, in order to exclude any possible bulging disc in the cervical vertebral column, which could lead to burning sensation in the neck and shoulders. In the meantime, I would recommend taking magnesium supplements, to help relieve the muscle spasm."

For the past 3 months, I have been experiencing this facial tightness which comes pretty often throughout the day with different intensity. The facial tension usually comes half an hour after I leave the bed. The tightness on my face happens to be on both sides of my face but usually more intense on the right. At times, I can feel it from my neck all the way up to my face. As of recent, I have been feeling this slight burning sensation on my chest to my shoulders as well. Prior to this facial tightness, I have been suffering from this burning feeling on the centre of my chest for about a month. It was my first time experiencing heartburn and I thought it was heart related. Went for X-rays and echo heart ultrasound. Everything came out fine. I have a healthy heart. What made the burning chest sensation go away temporarily is lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol. And the weird part is the same thing helps me relieve my facial tightness temporarily is the same thing as that for the burning chest sensation; lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol.Since having this facial tightness, I have paid numerous visits to different doctors, even the neuro-specialist and they all said it was anxiety. The doctors did facial senses test where they take a piece of fine cotton to touch different parts of my face. I had to close my eyes and tell them where the spot is. I have no troubles at all. I did blood test. It came out normal. They told me I do not need to do any scans and that it was merely anxiety and it will go off by itself. I convinced myself that I had anxiety because of the one month heartburn ordeal that I was suffering from. Even though the facial tightness was there, I tried my utmost best to ignore it. I do not think that I have any anxiety in me now as I try not to think of the weird tightness sensation. However, it has been 3 whole months and now I am getting alarmed and worried that it is still here and with newer sensations as I described above. In all honesty, I do feel that the intensity of the facial tension as compared to I first experienced it, is less. However, it is always there even as when I am typing this. I do not see any physical change on my body. Not sure if it is neuro damage. I am worried sick.Hope I can get some form of advice and diagnosis."

The fact that your symptoms are relieved by lying down, alcohol or physical activity is another argument in favour of anxiety. Anyways, before coming to this conclusion, I would recommend checking vitamin D plasma levels for possible deficiency and blood pressure for possible imbalances. It is also necessary performing a cervical spine X-ray study, in order to exclude any possible bulging disc in the cervical vertebral column, which could lead to burning sensation in the neck and shoulders. In the meantime, I would recommend taking magnesium supplements, to help relieve the muscle spasm."

For this reason, I would recommend consulting first with an ENT specialist in order to exclude a possible inner ear disorder, which could trigger this clinical situation. It is also necessary to perform a sinus x-ray study, inflammation tests (complete blood count, PCR, ESR) and thyroid hormone levels, in order to exclude a possible thyroid gland dysfunction. If all the above tests result are normal, I would recommend consulting a neurologist for a physical exam. A brain MRI may be necessary. I hope this helps."

For this reason, I would recommend consulting first with an ENT specialist in order to exclude a possible inner ear disorder, which could trigger this clinical situation. It is also necessary to perform a sinus x-ray study, inflammation tests (complete blood count, PCR, ESR) and thyroid hormone levels, in order to exclude a possible thyroid gland dysfunction. If all the above tests result are normal, I would recommend consulting a neurologist for a physical exam. A brain MRI may be necessary. I hope this helps."

Trench mouth or acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG) is a bacterial infection and is uncommon nowadays but it is highly associated with HIV infection and in kids with nutritional deficiencies. To be diagnosed with trench mouth or ANUG, symptoms like gum necrosis and ulceration, pain and bleeding (on just touching the gums) should be present. The main characteristic feature is fetid or the putrid odor which is caused due to the rotting gum tissue. And people diagnosed with ANUG has this odor, unless if they are under treatment in a very initial stage. It is certainly difficult for people with ANUG to eat a portion of normal or even less spicy food if they are not under treatment. It is treatable within a week by the usual antibiotic regimen and medicated mouth rinses. Gum infection such as this cannot occur only by fellatio. If your partner is diagnosed with immunocompromised diseases, respiratory infection, poor nutrition or has the habit of smoking, practice caution during the act. Proper protection and oral hygiene practices will prevent such infections. I hope this helps.  Take care."

We ran a battery of tests when it first happened including TSH, EKG, lung scans, blood panels, etc. and everything was normal. So we went down the path of anxiety. Four years later, the symptoms continued. As my son now has a terrible fear of doctors, we tried a home blood test to get a full thyroid panel. I have attached the results.The blood work came back normal. Low normal TSH, but low normal T4 and lower normal free T4 and free T3. There is nothing that shows an abnormality. However, his urine test showed moderately low iodine and slightly low selenium. I have read that abnormalities in these measures could cause thyroid problems. What am I wondering is if these two indicators are worth further exploration with an endocrinologist knowing that going to the doctor will cause my son a severe panic.Also, is it possible that low iodine could have been a temporary diet thing and it is masking the signs of hyperthyroidism in the blood work? He has all of the symptoms of someone with hyperthyroidism. On a side note, I am hypothyroid, my sister is hypothyroid and my two nieces had Hashimoto\\\\s with my younger niece having thyroid cancer and got her thyroid removed at age of 22.

I have gone through your query and you are having a habit of grinding your teeth during the night, that is called as bruxism and the symptomatic treatment for that is the use of mouth guards. I recommend you visit a dentist and get it checked. Your treatment depends on the grade of mobility. So, I am not quite sure about what grade of mobility you are having. The mobility can be in grade 1 or grade 2. If it is in grade 1, it will resolve on its own and if it is in grade 2, you need to go for scaling and root planing that is a 15 minutes procedure done only in the surgical environment. You can get mouth guards for your nightwear at any sports shop or get customed ones by giving an impression of your dental arch at the dental clinic. For more information consult a dentist online"

I have gone through your query and you are having a habit of grinding your teeth during the night, that is called as bruxism and the symptomatic treatment for that is the use of mouth guards. I recommend you visit a dentist and get it checked. Your treatment depends on the grade of mobility. So, I am not quite sure about what grade of mobility you are having. The mobility can be in grade 1 or grade 2. If it is in grade 1, it will resolve on its own and if it is in grade 2, you need to go for scaling and root planing that is a 15 minutes procedure done only in the surgical environment. You can get mouth guards for your nightwear at any sports shop or get customed ones by giving an impression of your dental arch at the dental clinic. For more information consult a dentist online"

My pain went away. After a few months, I started to have pain, but it was not so severe as the first time. I wear glasses and lenses, and I am treating my eye allergy with Chibro Cadron 5 ml, and for dry eyes, I use Fluidabak after taking the lens. Whenever I do my yearly eye checkup, my eyesight gets worse because of the pain in the corner, and I am scared about my sight. I do not know whether I use an appropriate medicine to my eye. Whenever I consult the doctor, he gives me the same medication. Please help me."

It is understandable that you are feeling weak since your body is producing red blood cells at an accelerated rate to compensate for the destruction occurring in the spleen. This is also the reason why your spleen is enlarged. If your condition worsens, your doctor might suggest a splenectomy. This will not cure the condition but will relieve the symptoms since the site of destruction of red blood cells will be removed and your red blood cells will be able to survive for a longer period in the blood. Splenectomy, however, can predispose one to certain bacterial infections and it is important that you receive the appropriate vaccines regularly. You could take folic acid and vitamin B12 supplements since one of your blood tests show macrocytic anemia. For more information consult a hematologist online"

And one may get symptoms like shortness of breath, chest pain or heaviness, dizziness, etc. Are you having ventricular or atrial ectopics? Have you undergone echo? Presence of ectopics also suggests the possibility of these arrhythmias. Usually, ECG is normal (attachment removed to protect patient identity) as it is done in between the episodes or may show ectopics. ECG done during episodes will show abnormality. You may request for portable cardiac monitor either Holter or another mobile-based rhythm monitor especially during intercourse to see the rhythm is recurring. Alternatively, you may undergo treadmill test and we can see if it recurs during the running.  Also, thyroid test should be done if not had recently. ln order to abort such episodes you should try to cough hard. Next time, you have this, focus on heart rate and measure pulse rate. These arrhythmias are not life-threatening. So overall, that episode may be an episode atrial arrhythmia rather than panic attack and our priority is to confirm it by investigations. Hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts. For more information consult a cardiologist online"

Presence of ectopics also suggests the possibility of these arrhythmias. Usually, ECG is normal (attachment removed to protect patient identity) as it is done in between the episodes or may show ectopics. ECG done during episodes will show abnormality. You may request for portable cardiac monitor either Holter or another mobile-based rhythm monitor especially during intercourse to see the rhythm is recurring. Alternatively, you may undergo treadmill test and we can see if it recurs during the running.  Also, thyroid test should be done if not had recently. ln order to abort such episodes you should try to cough hard. Next time, you have this, focus on heart rate and measure pulse rate. These arrhythmias are not life-threatening. So overall, that episode may be an episode atrial arrhythmia rather than panic attack and our priority is to confirm it by investigations. Hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts. For more information consult a cardiologist online"

The pain in the knee and wrist can be of different pathology and need a different approach. Coming back to the history, the swelling in lymph node if you suspect then you need a physician approach than the chiropractor. We need to check out why the lymph nodes got swollen. Is it due to any pathology or due to some external factors. Usually, this area does not allow lymph nodes to get swollen sooner until there is some pathology and it is always good on our side to take care of our body in proper guidelines. Hope you take this matter to a physician first rather than a chiropractor. As per my practice of 12 years I never recommend cases with lymph node issue to chiropractor as the job is different.

Are you having pain in the neck? Is the pain sharp shooting or dull aching? Are you feeling any kind of muscle tightness near the neck? Any signs of swelling? The pain in the knee and wrist can be of different pathology and need a different approach. Coming back to the history, the swelling in lymph node if you suspect then you need a physician approach than the chiropractor. We need to check out why the lymph nodes got swollen. Is it due to any pathology or due to some external factors. Usually, this area does not allow lymph nodes to get swollen sooner until there is some pathology and it is always good on our side to take care of our body in proper guidelines. Hope you take this matter to a physician first rather than a chiropractor. As per my practice of 12 years I never recommend cases with lymph node issue to chiropractor as the job is different. Degenerative disc disease. MRI cervical spine. Trapezitis. Neck pain. Ice pack and rest."

You must try for it whenever you and your partner feel ready to do so.

I am facing the problem like small bumps in the tongue, from the last two days a little bit of pain below ear region and it is a little swollen. Is it due to HIV? I am stressed, scared, full of tension. These are hampering my life. I do not know what to do. Today I am in the 107th day of exposure."

For the past five years, she was managing the pain with anti-inflammatory medicine, Lyrica, Mythycobal, Voltaren injections, herbal creams, etc. You can see the veins in her hands popping out. I also realized that the pain has got worse now.For about 12 months the doctor put her only on Prednisolone 5 mg/day and painkiller when necessary. She was fine till last month but the pain increased in her hands now. In the daytime she is fine and the pain starts mildly in the evening.

My question is what is the real answer, can I beat the virus and remove it from my body completely leaving only anti-bodies?"

So my blood results came back with an HCG OF 248 and the doctor said I am right around 1-2 weeks.So, here is my question. I have been stressing out badly due to the fact I have been on Lorazepam 1 mg every night for anxiety and PD for the last 2 years as well as Percocet 10 mg as needed for back pain. I have been taking both of the medications during my pregnancy when I had no idea I was pregnant. Since finding out I have tried tapering on both medications. The Percocet is making me sweat and very agitated and when I tried to cut down on the Lorazepam I was shaking and almost hallucinating and delusion. I also tried not taking the Lorazepam at all and woke up crying, shaking and sweating. I want to be off both these medicines but I am worried more about the Lorazepam as it is a class D pregnancy drug. I have read about the terrible problems this causes for infants. I am so scared that I am considering abortion. I do not want to be a terrible mother before I even give birth.
