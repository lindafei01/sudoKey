"Hello doctor,I had mumps five months ago and after that, I started to have an infection in my left testes. It was swollen and now it has shrunk to almost half the size of the other one. As I am sexually active, I feel a pain in each of the vas deferens after sex. If I do not have sex for days, they become sensitive. I was treated with Ceftum 500 mg, the first time I had an infection. Now my question is, is there any chance that the infection is still in my body? And, do I need to get examined for it? For the time being, please suggest some precautionary antibiotics for my relief.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I can understand your concern. You had mumps and this is a viral infection known to cause an inflammation of the testis in some cases. Take care. For more information consult a sexologist online"
"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Hello, Wellcome to ChatDoctor.

"Hello doctor,I am currently on the Yaz contraceptive pill. I skipped my sugar pills for around four months and had a breakthrough period this month. I had my period last week, but I still have some residual brown discharge for about a week now. Additionally, I had sex a few days ago and bled during it. Nothing hurts or is sore, I just want to know how long I am going to have the brown discharge and if I should be worried or if I should do anything about it?","Hello. The brown discharge should be temporary. I would recommend you have a period for the next couple of months and not skip the placebo pills temporarily to get back on track. If you have not missed any pills, pregnancy is very unlikely, but I would recommend a pregnancy test for added reassurance. If you have not had a recent test for STDs, like gonorrhea or chlamydia, I would also get tested for those, as these infections may have no symptoms and can cause spotting or bleeding after intercourse. If the problem continues, and no other cause can be found, you can consider changing to a different pill.  Take care."

"Hello doctor,I just got one side of my wisdom teeth removed both upper and lower six days ago, and I have another one scheduled after two days for the left side. The upper is 100 % fine, which they pulled. The lower they pulled the tooth without removing the root because it was too close to the nerve. I do have some stitching in this area currently on the lower cheek. Noticed a hard lump about 1 inch between my lower jawline and cheek area. Is this normal because of swelling or something else. Currently taking Amoxicillin 500 mg and Ibuprofen 600 mg. Please let me know what this hard lump is, also generally on the lower side where this lump is, remains sore.","Hello. The lump is mostly a hard swelling which forms postsurgical removal of the wisdom tooth or maybe even by swollen lymph nodes due to infection. It takes a week or two for the swelling to subside. Sometimes, if the root is still inside, the infection may be remaining there causing swelling. Get an X-ray done to find out the exact problem and stronger antibiotics like Augmentin (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid) along with a painkiller for a week.

"Hello doctor,I had deep unprotected sex for three minutes with a broken condom with a sex worker who looks younger and healthy and aged between 18. It was my first intercourse with a sex worker and I am worrying about expose to HIV. I have started fearing from the minute where I had broken condom intercourse and she said to me that she does not have HIV and they never allow anyone to have sex without a condom because of fear of getting infected. So there is no need to worry but I cannot believe her and started studying about HIV and its symptoms and I have a feeling of infection because I got red dots in my finger pits and cold and throat infection.I want to know what are the red dots on my finger which I got? I got it tested many times in those three months and got a negative result. I am worrying abt six months test.","Hi. Firstly, I want to tell you that the tests which are done these days are highly sensitive and specific and give accurate results. Congratulations on your three months HIV test, post-exposure being negative. Numerous studies have shown that 97 % of people will have enough antibodies to accurately test positive at three months. In some of the cases, it takes as long as six months to test positive, but this is rare. Since everyone\\s window period is different and as per the recommendations and I also suggest to get retested at six months. Red dots on finger pits, cold and throat infection can occur in various conditions not necessarily HIV. Relax. Move forward. Just go for a repeat HIV antibody test at six months.  Take care."
"Hello doctor,I need advice after my second CT chest result. Six months back, I went for a CT scan because I have got chest pain which suddenly comes and goes and I wanted to go for a check-up. The CT showed a right-sided nodule measuring 3 mm and was advised to RPT interval scan in six months. I have done the second CT, the previous nodule is still there and they found another one.In the LLL, a 4 mm nodule is representative of an intrapulmonary lymph node. No suspicious lung lesion. Tiny 3 mm RLL nodule noted. No enlarged lymph nodes. Mild thymic hyperplasia. The partly visualized upper abdominal viscera appear unremarkable. No aggressive bony lesion. They said I do not need to do anything which is strange because there are two nodes now and the second one was not there six months ago. Do I need some kind of medicine therapy to clear my lung from this node or do I need to check if it is growing or not after one year?","Hi. According to guidelines when there is a single nodule in the lung of size less than 3 mm we ask to follow up in six months for repeat CT. In the repeat CT, if we find any enlargement of the nodule or any new developments we usually ask for a biopsy of the existing nodule. That is how we practice. So, I think you should repeat your CT after six months and if the size increases, you should get a biopsy done."
"Hi doctor,I had sex for the first time. After that, I did not get my periods yet. I went to a gynecologist. She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone with ChatDoctor."

"Hello doctor,Some mornings during the week I get a quick flash of numbness over my left temple. It is never at night or during the day. It can happen more than once sometimes. If I move, roll over, or get up, I can make it stop. It does not hurt and is very fast. What does this sound like?","Hello.  I understand your concern and would explain that your symptoms are not typical of any neurological disorders. The emotional stress may trigger this numbness as it could be related to a muscle spasm in this region. Waking up is a kind of stress for the body as we pass from total rest during sleep to an active morning. Anyway, I do not think that you need to perform any tests as it does not indicate anything serious. So just relax and try not to think about it.  For more information consult a neurologist online"

"Hello doctor,I have had a fishy odor down there since I was in elementary school. I was not sexually active at all either. Just a couple years ago I realized I might have something called bacterial vaginosis. I went to the doctor for it a couple years ago and got prescribed Metronidazole and it did nothing for me. Ever since then I have not really gone to the doctor about it again. I am worried because I have read that BV left untreated can make you infertile. How common is it that this could happen? And do you have any tips for me?","Hello. Yes, you have heard right that if vaginal infections are left untreated they may lead to PID and infertility. It is a serious issue which must be dealt with promptly and appropriately. Bacterial vaginosis leads to change in vaginal flora and pH which results in fishy odor and discharge. Metronidazole is the recommended treatment for it but as you say it has not affected you then I would suggest that you must not neglect it and get yourself fully checked by having vaginal swabs tested and getting exact diagnosis and treatment.

"Hi doctor,I am a 25-year-old male. I do not have any medical history. Been always healthy. For the past 3 months, I have been experiencing this facial tightness which comes pretty often throughout the day with different intensity. The facial tension usually comes half an hour after I leave the bed. The tightness on my face happens to be on both sides of my face but usually more intense on the right. At times, I can feel it from my neck all the way up to my face. As of recent, I have been feeling this slight burning sensation on my chest to my shoulders as well. Prior to this facial tightness, I have been suffering from this burning feeling on the centre of my chest for about a month. It was my first time experiencing heartburn and I thought it was heart related. Went for X-rays and echo heart ultrasound. Everything came out fine. I have a healthy heart. What made the burning chest sensation go away temporarily is lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol. And the weird part is the same thing helps me relieve my facial tightness temporarily is the same thing as that for the burning chest sensation; lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol.Since having this facial tightness, I have paid numerous visits to different doctors, even the neuro-specialist and they all said it was anxiety. The doctors did facial senses test where they take a piece of fine cotton to touch different parts of my face. I had to close my eyes and tell them where the spot is. I have no troubles at all. I did blood test. It came out normal. They told me I do not need to do any scans and that it was merely anxiety and it will go off by itself. I convinced myself that I had anxiety because of the one month heartburn ordeal that I was suffering from. Even though the facial tightness was there, I tried my utmost best to ignore it. I do not think that I have any anxiety in me now as I try not to think of the weird tightness sensation. However, it has been 3 whole months and now I am getting alarmed and worried that it is still here and with newer sensations as I described above. In all honesty, I do feel that the intensity of the facial tension as compared to I first experienced it, is less. However, it is always there even as when I am typing this. I do not see any physical change on my body. Not sure if it is neuro damage. I am worried sick.Hope I can get some form of advice and diagnosis.","Hello. I read carefully your question and would agree with your Doctor on the fact that all your symptoms are suggestive of anxiety. The fact that your symptoms are relieved by lying down, alcohol or physical activity is another argument in favour of anxiety. Anyways, before coming to this conclusion, I would recommend checking vitamin D plasma levels for possible deficiency and blood pressure for possible imbalances. It is also necessary performing a cervical spine X-ray study, in order to exclude any possible bulging disc in the cervical vertebral column, which could lead to burning sensation in the neck and shoulders. In the meantime, I would recommend taking magnesium supplements, to help relieve the muscle spasm."
"Hello doctor,My mother is 75 years old. She had been treated for TB (tuberculosis) of the abdomen as her ultrasound of abdomen finding was thicken bowel loop. In general terms, it was informed about TB in her abdomen. Accordingly, medicines were given to her as per the advise of a local MD doctor. Treatment continued for three months and due to some discontinuation of medicine it relapsed and again she was diagnosed with Thicken bowel loop as per USG. Again treatment continued.However, while undergoing treatment she lost sensation in her legs and complained of losing sensation in her legs and numbness in her feet and was unable to put on slippers in her feet with difficulty in moving. She also complained that while moving she felt as if she was moving on a bed of soft cotton.Subsequent treatment by neuro experts revealed that overdose of treatment of her TB in abdomen resulted in this condition and she was diagnosed for peripheral neuropathy and was advised for biopsy for proper diagnosis. Meanwhile, she fell and hurt herself which was later on diagnosed that her spine at L3 - L4 was compressed due to felling abruptly and accordingly she was advised to take bed rest for three months. Slowly, she recovered from this condition felt pain in her back and was facing another kind of problem as she could not sit for a longer time and preferred to lay down on the bed.Finding her bad condition subsequetly, we also took consultation from other neuro experts at a prestigious institution where she was prescribed Lupivitin one tablet and Sammy one tablet.When condition persisted thereafter she was given Primosa one tablet daily, Neurox one tablet daily, Maxglobin 50 mg one tablet and Defart 6 mg.But, whenever she was given medicine her condition further aggravated. After about six months of treatment by the neuro expert, she has now been referred to the department of immunology for their advice. Meanwhile, we also took advice from a rheumatologist who diagnosed a kind of arthritis and started treating accordingly. He also started the course of Defzacort (steroid) along with other medicines. The steroid was prescribed with a decreasing dose per week from 60 mg per day to 6 mg per day.However, after taking about two months of steroid course her condition deteriorated and had severe breathlessness.

"Hi doctor,My wife missed her periods and we doubt she is pregnant. Our first kid is just 1 year old now and it was a Cesarean. We are not in a position to have a second child now. Her LMP was 22nd of last month. I read that Mifepristone can induce abortion. Is it a safe drug? Do we have to consult doctor for taking this drug? What are all the possible side effects? Is that drug 100 percent reliable? Is there any other options? Whether this drug is available without doctor\\s prescription? Thank you.","Hello. First, please confirm the pregnancy with a serum beta-hCG test (human chorionic gonadotropin) as urine pregnancy test is not reliable till eight days post missed periods. If the hCG levels are more than 5 ng/dL then she is pregnant. In that case as she has been a post C-section case, medical abortion is not to be undertaken with either Mifepristone or Misoprostol simply. Because, the C-section scar would still be weak by one year and there are often chances of uterus rupture. The best option in that case would be an ultrasound guided dilation and curettage procedure for surgical abortion. Please meet your gynecologist and get the needful.  Take care."
"Hi doctor,I have a question for my mother. My mother is 50 years old. She complains of episodic, sudden loss of weight bearing ability on the left Achilles tendon. This has resulted in two major falls, which resulted in trauma. These are present for past few months and have become more frequent in the last month. She also has pain in her knees bilaterally, which has been attributed to osteoarthritis. She also complains of hip pain associated with swelling and difficulty in standing, lying and changing sides while sleeping. There is episodic stiffness present in the shoulders, which causes some discomfort in raising arms above the shoulder level. She is taking Bisoprolol 5 mg and Amlodipine 5 mg for high BP and it is well-controlled. She has no history of any allergy. She has kidney stones and so occasional pain in the lumbar area. She used to get constipation frequently. She was hospitalized four times for normal vaginal deliveries and once for abortion. She is monogamous with her husband. She has a positive family history of hypertension in mother, CAD in father, mother and brother and uterine cancer in mother. She has a history of menorrhagia and cycles have become more irregular now. Then, diagnostic D and C was performed last year, which was normal. She will not smoke or drink.

"Hello doctor,A few months before, I developed a gastric issue that required treatment with PPIs. Soon into using the drugs I developed headaches, dizziness, and nausea. I changed the type of PPI three times but the symptoms persisted. The symptoms included a feeling of pressure above my right ear and behind my right eye. Later, I came off the PPIs and after using over the counter headache painkillers for three days the severity of the headaches eased. But the feeling of pressure remains to this day on the right side of the face. I often feel heavy head or even light-headed with a slight dizziness, often as if I am hung over. The symptoms come and go, but are there every day for differing periods of time. And the constant is this feeling of slight pressure on the right side of my head above the ear and extending sometimes down to the cheek and behind the right eye.","Hello. I read carefully your question and would explain that the dizziness does not seem to be related to PPI adverse effects, as it would have disappeared now. For this reason, I would recommend consulting first with an ENT specialist in order to exclude a possible inner ear disorder, which could trigger this clinical situation. It is also necessary to perform a sinus x-ray study, inflammation tests (complete blood count, PCR, ESR) and thyroid hormone levels, in order to exclude a possible thyroid gland dysfunction. If all the above tests result are normal, I would recommend consulting a neurologist for a physical exam. A brain MRI may be necessary. I hope this helps."
"Hello doctor,I would like to ask what is the likelihood that my partner who performs oral sex on me has trench mouth or acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis? He has no bad breath and he was able to have normal food. Can people with trench mouth have no bad breath and is able to eat normal food?","Hello. I understand your concern. Trench mouth or acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG) is a bacterial infection and is uncommon nowadays but it is highly associated with HIV infection and in kids with nutritional deficiencies. To be diagnosed with trench mouth or ANUG, symptoms like gum necrosis and ulceration, pain and bleeding (on just touching the gums) should be present. The main characteristic feature is fetid or the putrid odor which is caused due to the rotting gum tissue. And people diagnosed with ANUG has this odor, unless if they are under treatment in a very initial stage. It is certainly difficult for people with ANUG to eat a portion of normal or even less spicy food if they are not under treatment. It is treatable within a week by the usual antibiotic regimen and medicated mouth rinses. Gum infection such as this cannot occur only by fellatio. If your partner is diagnosed with immunocompromised diseases, respiratory infection, poor nutrition or has the habit of smoking, practice caution during the act. Proper protection and oral hygiene practices will prevent such infections. I hope this helps.  Take care."
"Hello doctor,My son has developed anxiety symptoms about four years ago. They came completely out of the blue. He was with someone who now has heart palpitations, sweaty palms and feet, and lightheadedness sitting in the living room. We ran a battery of tests when it first happened including TSH, EKG, lung scans, blood panels, etc. and everything was normal. So we went down the path of anxiety. Four years later, the symptoms continued. As my son now has a terrible fear of doctors, we tried a home blood test to get a full thyroid panel. I have attached the results.The blood work came back normal. Low normal TSH, but low normal T4 and lower normal free T4 and free T3. There is nothing that shows an abnormality. However, his urine test showed moderately low iodine and slightly low selenium. I have read that abnormalities in these measures could cause thyroid problems. What am I wondering is if these two indicators are worth further exploration with an endocrinologist knowing that going to the doctor will cause my son a severe panic.Also, is it possible that low iodine could have been a temporary diet thing and it is masking the signs of hyperthyroidism in the blood work? He has all of the symptoms of someone with hyperthyroidism. On a side note, I am hypothyroid, my sister is hypothyroid and my two nieces had Hashimoto\\s with my younger niece having thyroid cancer and got her thyroid removed at age of 22. So everyone on my side of the family has thyroid issues. We were wondering if you could please give us some guidance. Looking to see if we need to eliminate thyroid as a possible cause of his symptoms or if it is worth further pursuit.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Based on the details and the labs attached (attachment removed to protect patient identity), it seems very unlikely that the symptoms are coming from a thyroid issue. Urine iodine is really not helpful clinically in this case. Given the family history, I would ask you to monitor TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) once a year but that does not explain the severity of the symptoms at all.

There is a mild bright abnormal signal intensity in the right mastoid area and the left side is clear. Abnormal signal in mastoiditis means brighter on T2 and contrast images.

"Hello doctor,I am seriously facing acne pimples problem. Sometimes they occur on my face when I masturbate. If I use Mometasone, it gives a good result.Is it okay to continue this?","Hello. Acne is a universal issue in the age group of 15 to 25 years due to hormonal changes in adolescents. However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run. Acne is dependent on hormones hence excess masturbation may sometimes lead to an increase in the problem. I would advise you to stop Mometasone immediately and kindly upload appropriate images to help us assess your current grade of acne and treat you better. Regards.

"Hi doctor,My mother has a tumor-like thing in her shoulder. It is like a soft pulpy thing. Right now it is small and not causing much pain. When she works too much, she feels a weight on her shoulder and a mild pain like she has lifted a weight. Is that something cancerous?","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Thank you for using this platform. It sounds like your mother has a soft pulpy growth on her shoulder, which is painless at rest but causes heaviness on exertion. Although this information gives us some idea, it is challenging for me to guess what precisely this growth is. It will be nice if your mom could have it evaluated by an orthopedic surgeon. He or she will assess whether this growth is arising from the subcutaneous fat (example - lipoma), underlying muscle or bone or joint. If there is a suspicion of bony or joint involvement, an x-ray may need to be taken. There is a rare possibility that this swelling might not be a growth, but just a manifestation of trauma or infection. I will be happy to review any pictures, x-rays or other imaging that you may have already done. Hope this helps."
"Hi doctor,I am 18 years old. My problem is the teeth has become white for the past few years. The back portion of the teeth has become dark or black. Teeth are quite creamy. Often a bad smell spreads out from my mouth. My mother also suffers from this problem. I use whitening toothpaste but all are in vain. So, please doctor help me and give me a suggestion.",Hi. I read your query and can understand your concern. It seems like you have staining of teeth and plaque accumulation. Our mouth contains a great number of resident bacteria. Sometimes some individuals have staining bacteria which leads to physiological stains. This is not any pathology or disease. This staining often leads to plaque accumulation and bad smell from the mouth. You need professional teeth cleaning (scaling and polishing) regularly (usually every six months). Continue brushing twice daily with any toothpaste that suits you.

The doctor said it could be the dengue causing the spotting. She has not gotten her periods yet. I have read that there could be bleeding during pregnancy as well.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. If she had her period on the 25th of last month, then there is no chance that the bleeding on the 14th of this month was due to pregnancy.

"Hello doctor,I recently have noticed a slight blurriness in my right eye. It is only noticeable when I close my left eye, and so I am not sure how long it has taken for this to develop. I am going to see an optometrist and doctor early next week but am currently on the road for work.My main question is that when I look out of the corner of my right eye the blurriness seems to subside and I can see usually. I am wondering if this is a good sign. I have been dealing with severe anxiety the past couple months, and I am worried that might have raised my blood pressure enough to hurt my eyesight.Eyesight when looking with both eyes seems to be normal. I have also noticed floaters in my eyes. Kindly help.","Hello. This kind of a picture of eyesight becoming better on looking at specific directions are related to astigmatism. It is a very prevalent and correctable condition. There is no need to be anxious about it. Different reasons cause floaters. A dilated retinal examination will be able to help us get to the cause. Most of the conditions causing floaters are benign (not severe), but a few are dangerous, but all are treatable. So, I recommend that you visit your optometrist and in case you need any further information or help with refractive surgery, please schedule a consultation. I hope this helps you."

For a more manly look, the best solution is to do exercise. I have answered your question in the same order. Testosterone injections will not help to be manly unless your blood testosterone level is low.

I have had gallbladder out four years ago, I bruise easily, I do get little red skin dots at times, menstrual cycles can be irregular and spleen slightly enlarged.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I have gone through your lab reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and they are consistent with the diagnosis made by your doctor.Yellowish tint of the eyes is due to increased bilirubin levels. This is due to the increased red blood cell destruction in the spleen and is commonly a complication of hereditary spherocytosis. It is understandable that you are feeling weak since your body is producing red blood cells at an accelerated rate to compensate for the destruction occurring in the spleen. This is also the reason why your spleen is enlarged. If your condition worsens, your doctor might suggest a splenectomy. This will not cure the condition but will relieve the symptoms since the site of destruction of red blood cells will be removed and your red blood cells will be able to survive for a longer period in the blood. Splenectomy, however, can predispose one to certain bacterial infections and it is important that you receive the appropriate vaccines regularly. You could take folic acid and vitamin B12 supplements since one of your blood tests show macrocytic anemia. For more information consult a hematologist online"

"Hello doctor,I wanted to know if you could answer one question for me. I experienced an episode that lasted roughly about two to three minutes where I felt that I could not seem to catch my breath and it felt as if my heart had stopped beating. I checked my heart rate roughly three minutes after the incident and it was at 60 bpm and my oxygen was at 99 % under two weeks ago. I had a routine 24 tape which was clear (ectopic beats picked up but were benign). I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks. However, they generally come on during stressful situations. Could this be a panic attack symptom? I also wanted to add that this happened during intercourse (I am a 35-year-old male, height is 174 cm and weight is 100 kg). I look forward to your response and suggestions.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. This can be a cardiac arrhythmia like PSVT (paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia) or atrial fibrillation, in which heart rate suddenly goes up and also suddenly decreases. And one may get symptoms like shortness of breath, chest pain or heaviness, dizziness, etc. Are you having ventricular or atrial ectopics? Have you undergone echo? Presence of ectopics also suggests the possibility of these arrhythmias. Usually, ECG is normal (attachment removed to protect patient identity) as it is done in between the episodes or may show ectopics. ECG done during episodes will show abnormality. You may request for portable cardiac monitor either Holter or another mobile-based rhythm monitor especially during intercourse to see the rhythm is recurring. Alternatively, you may undergo treadmill test and we can see if it recurs during the running.  Also, thyroid test should be done if not had recently. ln order to abort such episodes you should try to cough hard. Next time, you have this, focus on heart rate and measure pulse rate. These arrhythmias are not life-threatening. So overall, that episode may be an episode atrial arrhythmia rather than panic attack and our priority is to confirm it by investigations.

What I see there might be some changes in the muscles which may have led to compression over the lymph nodes? Few basic things to ask before I proceed. Are you having pain in the neck? Is the pain sharp shooting or dull aching? Are you feeling any kind of muscle tightness near the neck? Any signs of swelling? The pain in the knee and wrist can be of different pathology and need a different approach. Coming back to the history, the swelling in lymph node if you suspect then you need a physician approach than the chiropractor. We need to check out why the lymph nodes got swollen. Is it due to any pathology or due to some external factors. Usually, this area does not allow lymph nodes to get swollen sooner until there is some pathology and it is always good on our side to take care of our body in proper guidelines. Hope you take this matter to a physician first rather than a chiropractor. As per my practice of 12 years I never recommend cases with lymph node issue to chiropractor as the job is different.

"Hello doctor,I had a silent missed abortion last year in the third month of my pregnancy. After that, I got some tests done, which resulted in CMV IgG positive. Then I got vaccinated for rubella to prevent any casualties in the next pregnancy. Now I want to try and conceive, but just now I got my torch panel done again. And now the HSV IGM is positive with 1.15 range along with CMV and rubella IgG positive. Should I wait or can I try to conceive right now? My husband\\s torch panel also done, nothing abnormal.I am currently under Folic acid and Multivitamin, for now, to conceive faster. And also a homeopathic medicine for migraine.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Yes, you can try for your pregnancy as IgG (immunoglobulin G) means that you do not have any current infection. It is only due to prior exposure. And for HSV, the only thing you have to watch is the presence of active lesions. Otherwise, there is no other reason not to try for pregnancy. You must try for it whenever you and your partner feel ready to do so. Secondly, abortion is a very common thing in reproductive age and only after one abortion there is no need to undergo all these extensive investigations. I hope it has helped you."

"Hi doctor,I am coming here for what I think may be possible lower back muscle spasms. I originally felt the pain after playing lots of baseballs (swinging a baseball bat many times). I have symptoms such as tightness, limited mobility or restricted range of motion, throbbing pain, and sometimes it gets so bad that it became hard for me to even walk or sit! I went to my athletic trainer a month ago, and she told me she thinks it is just an aggravated muscle spasm. So she told me to just give it some rest from the activity that hurt it. So I gave it about a month, in which it seemed there was no pain. But as soon as I tried to do the activity that hurt me in the first place, it went right back to hurting. It would be of great help for any assistance. What should I do now?","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I read your concern. I feel that spasm could be due to less core stability and excessive spasm. Invariable loading hip joint reducing its range on movement. I would like to suggest you get more insight of your symptoms like is there any pain on bending forward touching the floor. Or arching back or inside bending. I recommend you to kindly do apply ice frequently over the painful area. A lot of frequent stretching for gluteus, hip flexors, and oblique muscles, a back extension like cobra stretches 20X4 at least three times in a day. Keep icing every time after stretch, core stability exercises. Kindly do these for two weeks and revert back to me."

She had negative home pregnancy tests, a negative test at the doctor, and had a miscarriage the next day after doctors test. My question is, could it be possible there is another fetus remaining inside? I only ask because we each have one parent that is a twin.

She is on birth control andused a Plan-b pill. How is any of this miscarriage stuffpossible especially after just seeing the doctor the day beforemiscarriage?","Hi. If Bhcg (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin) test or urine pregnancy test says she is pregnant then we can say she is pregnant. And if Bhcg test is positive and healthy if it is decreasing with the history of bleeding then we can say it was a miscarriage. Or we find a fetus part in ultrasound scan or test bleeding parts then we can say that it was pregnancy. It can be possible. The twin part, I cannot say. Need to do an ultrasound scan to check the status of pregnancy. Sometimes early there is implantation bleeding only."
"Hello doctor,I was diagnosed with dysphonia about a month ago. I have had a couple of speech therapy sessions but progress is glacial. I am still hoarse and in pain. I have been on 40 mg of Omeprazole for a month and Gaviscon Double Action for two weeks. I feel like the back of my throat is still swollen and I have pain in the corners of my throat. This only briefly eases when I really do some throat opening exercises. I cannot talk for very long without everything getting sore still. I have been like this since the beginning of the year since I had a chest infection and pneumonia. My mouth is now getting sore from all the Gaviscon tablets as the liquid irritates the corners of my throat. I really do not know what else I can do. I am having panic attacks and starting to feel like the only option is to take my life. I had a post nasal drip for most of the year so far and I am trying to get my salivary glands to work again properly.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Muscle tension dysphonia takes time to get cured. A few sessions of speech therapy are not going to rid you of the problem. Muscle tension dysphonia occurs due to various reasons and can be present after laryngitis or pneumonia as in your case. As an ENT surgeon, I would like to see the laryngoscopy video myself to ascertain if indeed the false vocal cords are producing voice instead of the true ones. Dysphonia plica ventricularis is the grade 2 of muscle tension dysphonia. Dysphonia plica ventricularis is when the false cords medialize to produce voice. Continue the speech therapy and anti-reflux treatment like your ENT surgeon and audiologist has prescribed. The speech therapy is aimed at suppressing maladaptive phonatory mechanisms and learn techniques designed to minimize muscular tension. Do write back to us if you need any further information on this. But at the same time please be patient with this problem to get resolved. Take adequate voice rest and whenever you use voice take care not to raise the voice or use unnatural frequencies. For more information consult an ENT otolaryngologist online"

So I finally went to the doctor and they prescribed me SMZ, TMP DS. I took it for about a week until I realized I was having a lot of side effects and an allergic reaction especially around my mouth. At first I thought I was just breaking out. Then it was not like sores or blisters. I kept self-treating the rash around my mouth and stopped taking the antibiotics. For a couple days it was gone. I was happy. Then I was in the sun one day for soccer and it was just like another rash but worse. I stayed home from school, did not do anything because I just wanted to get it better.

I would appreciate the severity of this infarction and whether it could be a machine error. Could you also tell me by perhaps drawing on the shot what waves and shapes indicate problems?","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I have gone through your report (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It is unlikely to be a machine error. Errors do not have such patterns and it is suggestive of old infarction only. Its present in inferior leads, which suggests inferior part of the heart is damaged and these are relatively less severe kind of infarction. However, an echo will give a better idea regarding the severity and extent of damage done. So it is better to get an echo done, if not done yet. Now, you can see in lead 1, P wave followed by a sharp spike called as QRS complex followed by an upright wave called as T-wave. So now, you can see in lead 2, 3, and AVF which are inferior leads, showing downward QRS spike instead of upward and T-wave is also inverted suggestive of heart damage. So, the next step is an echo to look for the extent of damage and followed by angiography to see the blockages and if needed then revascularization.

"Hi doctor, I have one white lump around the tonsil area in my throat. It has been there a good few months now and the area is swollen. Is this cancer?",Hi. Cancer cannot be diagnosed by inspection only. To exclude tonsillar stone you have to perform lateral neck X-ray and show me it later on. I advise you to use a mouthwash and gargle your pharynx then expectorate it many times during the day for a week. Then if the white spot still exists you may have to undergo tonsillectomy. Then examine the tonsillar tissue histologically to detect its nature. For more information consult an ENT-otolaryngologist online  Take care.

As there is oligomenorrhoea and your menses have returned after a long time, eight months now, it is essential that the cause needs to be investigated. The likely reasons are PCOS (polycystic ovarian syn ChatDoctor.  You need to get a complete hormonal profile with serum estradiol and serum testosterone levels with ultrasound pelvis to look for ovarian cysts (PCOS). The bleeding post intercourse is likely due to cervical erosions, which can cause bleeding and hence, a per speculum exam with a Pap smear is necessary as well. The ultrasound can deduce the endometrial thickness and if thick then an endometrial biopsy may also be taken for histopathological examination and learning the phase of the endometrium. In the meantime, you should be placed on antifibrinolytics like Tranexamic acid for controlling heavy bleeding. Obesity itself is a part of insulin resistance in PCOS, which can cause ovulation and hence delayed menses often. Please review with reports for further discussion and advice."

"Hello doctor,I had kissed a prostitute on lips and breast but did not have intercourse with her. I have no cut on lips and mouth. Is there any chance of me getting any STI?","Hi. It is really great that you want to know about an important issue and just do not want to make assumptions on your own. STIs are the diseases that are typically transmitted during sexual intercourse. It is unlikely to catch sexually transmitted infections with kissing alone, but with a few exceptions if the STI has manifested itself orally and/or in oral fluid of that person. Hepatitis B virus can be transmitted through kissing as the virus is found in saliva and other body secretions of HBV infected person. Herpes infection- This can be transmitted through kissing with a person who has a visible cold sore. Human papillomavirus (HPV) or warts and syphilis are less likely to be transmitted through kissing. So far, there is no reported case of HIV transmission through kissing.  Take care."

The first and the most probable cause could be posterior vitreous detachment, this is a benign condition not requiring any treatment.

Here, although you do experience floaters just like in posterior vitreous detachment, the floaters are more numerous and keep increasing with time. You will also have a reduction in vision with nonseeing areas in your visual field. This often needs to be treated surgically. I recommend you to visit an ophthalmologist.

If this is the first time that you are experiencing excessive bleeding and clots are being passed, then you can opt for antifibrinolytics for controlling the bleeding presently. You can choose for an ultrasound pelvis once the bleeding stops to look for an organic cause. A single episode can be more likely to be due to stress-induced hormonal imbalances. You may maintain a menstrual calendar for the next three months and see if the pattern persists. If it does, you may be required to be placed on oral contraceptive pills for at least three months to control such menorrhagic episodes."

Second time, I started having this brownish or yellowish discharge and I have taken the photo of the discharge. I am not sure what it is? Neither of us have STDs. I am quite scared of being pregnant. I do not remember when I had my last period. Is this discharge normal? Please help me.","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. The brownish discharge seems to be due to rupture of your hymen. Generally, if you have sex for the first time in case of a virgin, then the hymen gets partly withered or at times does not. However, during repeated acts of intercourse, there are fair enough chances that it ruptures and maybe that is the cause of brownish discharge after the second time. However, we will wait and watch as there is no such matter of concern. If it happens again, then please do visit a nearby gynecologist and get an internal check done. Coming to the pregnancy point, if you do not remember your periods date, then at least get a urine pregnancy test done after one month and wait for the results. If the result is negative, then repeat the test after a week."

I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The age of the patient is 72 years.

"Hello doctor,Just two days ago I found out I was about 1-2 weeks pregnant. And it has been about 4 1/2 weeks since my last menstrual period. Unfortunately with labor day being this weekend I have been unable to see my regular OBGYN. But I did go to the ER to confirm the pregnancy 2 days ago. So my blood results came back with an HCG OF 248 and the doctor said I am right around 1-2 weeks.So, here is my question. I have been stressing out badly due to the fact I have been on Lorazepam 1 mg every night for anxiety and PD for the last 2 years as well as Percocet 10 mg as needed for back pain. I have been taking both of the medications during my pregnancy when I had no idea I was pregnant. Since finding out I have tried tapering on both medications. The Percocet is making me sweat and very agitated and when I tried to cut down on the Lorazepam I was shaking and almost hallucinating and delusion. I also tried not taking the Lorazepam at all and woke up crying, shaking and sweating. I want to be off both these medicines but I am worried more about the Lorazepam as it is a class D pregnancy drug. I have read about the terrible problems this causes for infants. I am so scared that I am considering abortion. I do not want to be a terrible mother before I even give birth.

Would it be too soon to be considering this operation?","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Your query is genuine and I am extremely sorry to learn about your problems. To answer, let me explain to you how a nerve grows. It takes one month of latency and later nerve grows at 1 mm per day. Even though the nerve might reach your muscle, for bulk to improve, it takes another few months. For one to determine if the nerve signals have improved, you can get an electromyography to see for any improvement. Decompression will improve sensation very fast and then power. But for muscle bulk, it usually takes a while for muscle transfer to be suitable. In case, you have any form of weakness and never to fill up a cosmetic defect such as hypothenar flatness, for that one can consider fat grafting. If the bulk does not improve after six months. I would advise you to wait as it usually takes longer than 14 weeks. If you want to see and have proof of progress go for EMG. No muscle transfer as per my advise for now if you are not having any weakness. For more information consult a plastic surgeon online"

In fact, you need to decrease the dose of Glycomet GP 2 (Glimipiride and Metformin) to Glycomet GP 1. Major problem is that you have accelerated bloodstream pressure.

"Hello doctor,I am a 30 year old male, who is a competitive athlete. I do not have any structural or plumbing heart issues. I have been diagnosed with WPW accidentally, and I am waiting for an ablation in 17 days. I am mostly asymptomatic, and I never had any extremely rapid heart rates. My resting heart rate is actually in the 40\\s. However, I do sometimes get palpitations and every once in awhile get a run of 5 to 7 in a row. The EP I saw in the hospital prescribed me Flecainide 50 mg, twice daily. I saw another EP, who was a much older guy, as a second opinion. He seems to think I do not need the Flecainide, and maybe not even the ablation. I do not agree with him on the ablation due to recent medical studies on WPW and how ablation is recommended even for asymptomatic patients, especially athletes.My question is regarding Flecainide. I have not had any palpitations since I began taking it a few days ago, but I want to make sure this drug is not putting me at risk for creating a dangerous rhythm. Reading case studies and medical journals, it seems there is some risk. I have not been known to go into AF, and besides palpitations, I am asymptomatic with WPW. Do you think Flecainide at this dosage is safe and reasonable for the next two weeks, until my ablation?","Hi. In WPW (Wolff-Parkinson-White) syn ChatDoctor.

"Hi doctor,My daughter had braces for four years but her midline is off and she has a gummy smile. Her bite is fine but her teeth are not properly aligned and she does not have bone on her left side. Her orthodontist referred her to a maxillofacial surgeon who says she needs her upper jaw broken and rotated clockwise and slightly up to compensate for the lack of bone and her bottom jaw also has to be broken and rotated clockwise.

The procedure which you mentioned is called as orthognathic surgery which is done if there is a skeletal malrelation between the two jaws which cannot be corrected by orthodontics alone.

Will doing a squint surgery be of any use? Is there anything that I can try?","Hello. Diplopia is occurring definitely due to squinting because, in this, the image which is formed will be defocussed. It has occurred secondary to the trauma. The only remedy is to correct it by surgery. If it would have been due to other causes which were intrinsic to the eye then the chances would have been to correct by glasses.

"Hi doctor,I have a lower wisdom tooth that has been infected chronically for well over a year. I also have an upper molar that is broken decayed and has been like this for years. The wisdom tooth oozes green pus if you apply pressure with a cotton swab. The decayed tooth is mildly painful. I saw my dentist a few days ago, who did not seem overly concerned.

"Hello doctor,I have pain in my upper wisdom teeth for the past one year. I had visited a dentist for a check-up. He did X-ray of my teeth and told me that food stuck between molar teeth and wisdom teeth is causing pain. So he advised me to remove wisdom teeth and filling process. But I am scared that upper teeth have a connection with brain and eyes. So, the process of teeth removal can harm my eyes and brain. Please advise me what I can do. If I do not remove my teeth, then what will be its side effect?","Hi. I have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. This is a misconception that there is a direct connection between wisdom teeth to brain and eyes. There is no such relationship between the two. Wisdom teeth are vestigial and do not function if your other teeth are in good position. If you get it removed, there will be no problem to your eyes or brain.

"Hello doctor,My mother is 51 years old and she had thyroid sometime in the past. There are no signs of it from the last one year. However, she has these bulging eyes all the time, but she can perfectly see everything with her spectacles. I do not really know what happened to her the other day. She was watching her favorite TV show and all of sudden, her right eye popped out of her eye socket and she started shouting. It was such a scary and frightening situation where I and my dad did not know what to do and out of nowhere, my dad suddenly pushed her eye with a little pressure and the eye was back in its position as usual. My mom experienced severe pain after this incident when she was rushed to an Ophthalmologist. The doctor had no clue about the reason for her eye pop out. However, I advised her to go through a few medical tests and the results are yet to come.

But the symptoms suggest it would be hyperthyroidism or Graves' disease. I hope your mother is on medication otherwise the condition might worsen.

The results for measles and mumps show high antibodies which mean immunity is either due to past infection or vaccination.

It occurs because of your tension and anxiety about performing sex or previous bad sexual experiences.

The symptoms seem secondary to upper respiratory tract infection. Fever sometimes takes time to settle and may take up to a week. If cough and fever continue beyond 10 days then get a chest X-ray done to rule out pneumonia.  Meftal (Mefenamic acid) needs to be given only if fever is not controlled with Paracetamol.

"Hello doctor,I have an anal fissure, internal hemorrhoid, SRUS, and constipation. One year ago, I was suffering from a hard stool that was difficult to pass. I went to a gastroenterologist, who did a colonoscopy and found that I had an anal fissure and internal hemorrhoid. He prescribed Sitcom Forte, Eldicet, Velgut, and Pankreoflat. He also gave me Sucralcoat Ano cream. However, every night I was in too much pain. So, early this year, I decided to consult an Ayurveda doctor who gave me some Kashayams and tablets. However, my pain did not subside. I used to evacuate the stools using my fingers. That eliminated the stools, but there was so much mucus released and extreme pain after motion. Two months ago, I went to a GP who gave me some antibiotics and painkillers for five days. During this time, I was always sleepy. I took leave from work and was always tired and fatigued. Earlier this month, I went to another GI specialist who did a sigmoidoscopy and said that it is SRUS. He said that I should not finger evacuate the stools and gave me liquid paraffin and LoX cream. Now, my current situation is that it has been three days and I am very constipated and fatigued. The pain has subsided a little. However, I am not passing stools as I used to before.

Also, are there safety issues combining these medicines? Should I cancel this procedure?","Hi. Usually, for cardiac procedure anesthesiologist will prefer Fentanyl than Propofol because Fentanyl is opioid and it causes good pain relief and sedation and there is a high probability of heart stability and the chances of losing your breath and consciousness with Fentanyl is very less but still you will be made to sleep and remain pain-free.

"Hi doctor,I had unprotected sex on day 13 of my cycle and had an I-pill a day later. Again, I had sex in a gap of three days after the intake of tablet. I am really worried if I should take the pill again. This was a terrible mistake. Please help.","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I am assuming that you have regular monthly periods. In that case, it is the time where you are going to ovulate. So, it is an unsafe period to have sex. And, if you have once unprotected sex and have taken I-pill (emergency contraceptive pill) once, then why to make mistake for the second time. Because, I-pill in itself is not 100% effective even if taken once. There is no study about two times taken I-pill. It works with two mechanisms. First of all, it will delay ovulation and second, it brings bleeding. So, if pregnancy happens, it resists implantation. In your case, if I believe that ovulation is delayed while you have taken the tablet, then it is good. If you have taken the tablet for the second time, then the ovulation is more delayed and period will be somewhat late with more chance of avoiding pregnancy. The second thing is that with I-pill your period cycle can become irregular. The chance of that increases more if you have taken two times. Because, it is a chemical (hormone), which is produced in your body to maintain your regular cycle. And, when you take it from outside it can disturb your normal cycle. If you do not want pregnancy in the first place, then either use condom or other method as preferred by you both after discussing with your doctor. I-pill is an emergency contraceptive and not a regular contraceptive pill that you can take as and when required. It should be taken when fear of failure of normal contraception is more. So, make the thing clear about whether you want pregnancy or not and go for a solution which helps you in future."

If you mean the regular pill, do not use the phrase morning-after pill as that means an emergency pill used only once or twice depending on the dose.If you meant the regular pills which seems so from your history, she need not have to worry if the delay in taking the pill has not been more than 24 hours. It is fine to have taken it a few hours late as long as she has not skipped the pill that day. There is no need to take an additional pill if she has not missed the day\\s pill.

I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you have been suffering from difficulty in breathing due to aching of the left rib part that radiates toward shoulder which may occur when you fall asleep on sofa in an awkward position.

You may feel a sharp pain after intercostal muscle strain or sprain due to sleeping in the wrong position. The pain will become worse when you stretch, breathe in deeply, cough, or sneeze. The area of the strain between your ribs may be painful to touch. Again this pain can radiate to shoulders or sometimes side sleeping can cause damage to the rotator cuff and create a lot of pressure in this group of tendons and eventually produce pain.

It causes me to panic and get a lot of anxiety afterward. What could this electrical rush sensation be? Then, also, after I get it, I cannot look up too quickly because I feel very dizzy. It usually happens again, while typing on the computer or looking down at a smartphone.","Hello. I will try my level best to help you out. Your symptoms are mostly dizziness, which worsens with sudden eye movements or body movements, and are sometimes associated with headaches. Based on the symptoms, the most common cause in your age group is a vestibular migraine or benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). I assume you do not have any other risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, previous stroke or diagnosis of epilepsy. A simple neurological exam using Dix Hallpike Maneuver can help differentiate between BPPV and vestibular migraine. Also, further questions on the quality of headache, location and associated symptoms such as light sensitivity, loud noise sensitivity and nausea are other important questions, that can happen with vestibular migraine. Treatment for BPPV is physiotherapy with some specific exercises and medicines such as Topiramate or Valproic acid for vestibular migraine. If there are any red flags on neurological exam, then an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of the brain would be needed. Please do not hesitate to ask me any other questions. Take care.

But, the doctor has told to get DNA test that is an NIPT test. Is it important? If level 1 and the double marker are fine then DNA and NIPT test should also be fine right?","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum.

"Hello doctor,I was suffering from minor Achilles tendinopathy and visited a physiotherapist today to get it checked. During the session, he performed some deep tissue massage on the calf (which was very tight) to relax it, which was very painful. After the massage, I experienced sharp pains while walking (which was not there beforehand), and when I brought this up with the physio, he said it was normal because it was the first time I had gotten deep tissue massage on that area.I have been icing the calf and resting, and while it has gotten a little better, it still hurts to walk. I have my exams tomorrow which I have to get to and other events on the weekend where I have to be (and will involve walking). I am worried about how I can see as I cannot walk at all.

"Hello doctor,Approximately one week ago, I had my wisdom teeth removed. On my lower left, I have a dry socket, which I am getting treated for via packing (at least I think that is what it is called). On the right side, healing is just fine, however, I noticed some white stuff lodged in the gum. I am not sure if it is food or scar tissue because when I tried to get it out with a toothpick, it did not come out very easily, so I left it alone. Is this food or scar tissue? It is mildly bothersome.I brush my teeth but know to be careful around the surgical sites so they do not get irritated. It seems like a lot of plaque builds up back there because of this, and I am not quite sure what to do. Also, there is a very small spot of red gums on the front side of my second molar. I put a bit of mouthwash on it with a toothpick and left it alone.I have two questions, what is the whitish stuff that feels like food trapped in my healing gum socket? And what is this small patch of irritated gum on my second molar? Any help is appreciated.I am currently on Celexa (for depression), 600 mg of Ibuprofen (for wisdom tooth pain).","Hi. As it is just one week of wisdom teeth extraction, the white stuff seems to be most probably healing tissue only. It is a normal appearance of healing tissue post-extraction. A white patch of irritated gum can be due to injury or ulceration that can be due to accidental injury with the extraction instrument or can be due to injury with a toothbrush or any hard food. You can apply Chlorhexidine gel over it. Do warm saline gargles, antiseptic mouthwash gargles and brush your teeth twice a day for keeping plaque and deposits less accumulated. I hope this helps."

Lately, I have been experiencing severe mood swings and have not been myself. One minute I am dancing around the room and could not be happier, the next I am either crying or very angry. Normally, I do not cry and I am usually pretty laid back. I have also been getting dizzy mostly when I stand up or walk up the stairs. I have trouble sleeping and or sleeping too much. I am hungry all the time, however, when I do eat I feel nausea. I have done some research and have found that these symptoms are both common with the injection and also with pregnancy. How do I tell, if these are pregnancy symptoms or if it is because of the Depo shot? I did miss my last shot three months ago. Last month I took a home pregnancy test it came back negative. Will a home test be enough to tell if I am pregnant or not?","Hi. The home pregnancy test is fairly sensitive and very unlikely to miss pregnancy (except in very early pregnancy). If you suspect pregnancy strongly, you can repeat a home pregnancy test again after a week if period does not start. Most of your symptoms can be either due to indigestion or hormonal imbalance (hypothyroidism or estrogen deficiency). You can take antacids Pantoprazole for three to four days and see if symptoms resolve. If your symptoms do not resolve and pregnancy test comes negative, you can do TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) test to rule out hypothyroidism. As you have taken depot for a long time, estrogen deficiency is likely, which can cause all of your symptoms. If possible shift to oral pills for contraception for a few months to avoid the same. I hope this helps."
"Hello doctor,I had stomach pain after which my report was confirmed as gallbladder stones. What is the further procedure? Please let me know all the details, including the cost.","Hello, Welcome back to ChatDoctor. The mere presence of gall stones does not mean that your abdominal pain was from the gall bladder. Many people have gall bladder stones which do not give them any symptoms. When the gall bladder gets inflamed or when a gall bladder stones block the bile duct, you get symptoms like pain, fever, and jaundice. So, we need to ascertain whether the gall bladder stone was responsible for your abdominal pain or not. If it appears that the stone was the cause of your pain, then surgery can be considered.

You should, however, first make sure that the abdominal pain was directly related to the gall bladder stone. Please upload the copy of the scan report, and also indicate in which part of the abdomen you had pain. The gall bladder is located under the right rib cage margin. I hope this helps."

Last week after almost two years of not having a UTI I felt the horrible symptoms again. When going to the doctors UTI urine test came back positive.

I went back to the clinic the same day to get it checked and take more antibiotics.But to my surprise, the urine test came back clear for UTI, and my symptoms disappeared. Then the doctor advised me to get tested for Chlamydia as the symptoms can sometimes be mistaken to be UTI. I have been diagnosed with Chlamydia at the beginning of this same relationship and was treated for it. My partner was also tested, but his results came back negative. Is it possible that the treatment that I had for Chlamydia 8 years ago did not clear it entirely and this lead to several UTIs and kidney infections?

Her left leg (to us) is weaker than her right and her left leg does not bend as much as her right leg. She began to speak around 10 months of age then her speech left. We came to find out she had chronic fluid and a month back she had tubes placed. I am hearing more vowel and consonants now but no true words yet. She makes fine eye contact. Her non-verbal communication is good. She responds to her name but not always. She is beginning to learn more of what we are saying, she plays with some toys, is not terribly social. We are thinking that she may be on the autism spectrum and we have an evaluation soon to determine that. But my question is, could this be cerebral palsy?","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I understand the situation you are facing with your child. As there is no history of perinatal insult and NICU stay at birth, cerebral palsy could be less likely at this early age to diagnose. The description you made is more of a like to be an autistic spectrum disorder. But this could be just a small delay in catching up all milestones. Some kids learn early and some little late. So, observe over a period and if no improvement is seen, then consult a pediatric neurologist and developmental specialist for further evaluation and management."
"Hi doctor,I sat on my testicle before two months, and I experienced an initial sharp pain for a few hours. I went to the ER and did a blood test, urine test and an ultrasound. Torsion, as well as infection, was ruled out.The exact incident occurred before few days. I did a urine test and another ultrasound. Torsion was ruled out once again. When the pain flared up again, I went to the doctor back. Again, I did an ultrasound, urine test, and blood test. Torsion and infection were ruled once again.The doctor pointed out a little bit of fluid around my testicle, and I had no pain. But, still, I have pain in my testicle. What was ruled out with these tests? From where does the pain arises?","Hi. I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). This acute testicular pain with normal testis examination and ultrasound report look like simple orchialgia. Ruling out torsion is very important in young males presenting with testis pain. It shows that the testis is not twisted on its own. Pathologic pain has associated redness and swelling. From your report, I can say that you do not have torsion and epididymitis. Young males have simple orchialgia due to muscle tone. You need scrotal support. Take tablet Pregabalin 75 mg at bedtime."
"Hi doctor,I got an accident before a month. I got a right knee ACL ligament type 2 tear. Is it possible for the type 2 ligament to get cured by itself without operation and if so, how many days does it take to heal?","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) tears will not heal on its own as they are inside the joint. To bring the ends together, you need surgery, but even that too is not successful. It is the reason for doing ACL reconstruction. It is not recommended for everyone. Only if your knee is giving way or if it is unstable or when you are unable to lead an athletic life, then you need an ACL reconstruction."
"Hi doctor,I am a 30 year old female. I have a minor issue. About a month and a half ago, there was an incident where the condom broke. About 36 hours later, my husband got me four of the morning-after pills, and I took them all at once. Three days later, I started experiencing nausea, soreness of the breasts, lower back as well as abdominal pain, frequent urination, and tiredness. This carried on for almost a week. I then noticed a light brown discharge. And, from the next day, I bled for six days. I usually bleed for seven days. After my periods, I still had the symptoms.Nearly a month later, I got my periods again, but on the first day I had severe cramps and used a tampon. On the third day, there was a slight discharge which was brown in color. On the fourth day, there was some bleeding, but not at night. Today would be day five, and I still do not see blood. My main concern is that my vagina feels different. It is more firm than usual and feels tight. I sometimes feel a pulling sensation. Could it be due to the morning-after pills? I did home pregnancy tests, and it came back negative. It has been a month and 18 days now, since the intercourse.","Hello. Please let me know if you were previously pregnant. Since you took the emergency contraception pill within 36 hours, and you got your period after the intercourse, you are not pregnant. The emergency contraception pills are progesterone tablets. It is a hormone normally present in the body, which is secreted in the second half of your menstrual cycle. It gradually decreases in concentration due to which you get your menses. This gradual  ChatDoctor.  When you take progesterone orally in a higher dose to prevent pregnancy, some females experience the side effects of the tablets.

"Hello doctor,I am a 29-year-old female. I was just diagnosed with chronic urticaria. I went to an allergic specialist for skin testing because my skin was so sensitive I reacted to everything. They then did the RAST test on me. Everything came out class 0 except for egg white, wheat, and oats being class 2 and milk, and hazelnut being class 1. Can these cause anaphylaxis? How accurate are the RAST test? I was put on an elimination diet but the hives are still there. I occasionally get angioedema with it also. Can angiodema cause anaphylaxis? As you can see I am so scared for my throat to close up that I am scared to eat anything. I have only been eating a couple of things daily and live off that.","Hello,  Welcome to ChatDoctor. RAST is a highly accurate test. If the test is positive for a specific allergen, it shows that you are sensitized to that particular allergen. This means that you may mount an allergic response when you are exposed to that allergen. However, it does not mean that you will necessarily have an allergic reaction to that substance and, nor does it mean that any reactions will be severe. If the test is negative, it means that one does not have the ability to mount an allergic reaction to that allergen and any symptoms one may be experiencing are probably not due to an allergic reaction to that substance. However, the results of the RAST need to be interpreted in conjunction with your clinical history. e.g the presence of allergy to some or few allergens which may possibly be present either in the environment or food does not necessarily mean that they are responsible for the symptoms because if they are not even present in the environment or food of an individual, then they are irrelevant. In your case, an elimination diet has not helped thus proving the fact that RAST test results should be carefully interpreted along with clinical history and does not necessarily mean that you will necessarily have an allergic reaction to the substance that you tested. Angioedema is frequently associated with urticaria. Pathogenesis is the same for both urticaria as well as angioedema. The presence of angioedema does not always mean that it is a part of anaphylaxis. Angioedema can be a part of anaphylaxis in those individuals who have a severe allergic reaction to an allergen with high levels of antibodies circulating in the blood. Since you have only class 1 and 2 level antibodies therefore it is unlike that these antigens or allergens would cause anaphylaxis."
"Hello doctor,Since the last 10 months, my periods are very irregular. I get periods only once every three to four months. I am on treatment for abdominal TB since the last one and a half years. I take Sompraz D20 on an empty stomach in the morning. I take Duonase nasal spray (two puffs in each nostril) twice a day. I take Immunace Forte after lunch and Libotryp at bedtime. So, why are my periods not regular? Is this a side effect of my medicine or could it be due to a disease? Recently, I was also prescribed Uprise-D3 (60000) once a month for six months. My recent 25-OH vitamin D total is 21.1 ng/mL. I also have sudden weight gain. My weight in the last one and a half years increased from 57 kg to 81 kg. I also have a chronic nose block.","Hello.

"Hi doctor,I had a history of thyroid issue before pregnancy. Currently, I have an issue of hair fall and mild body aches.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. The likely cause for hair loss is low hemoglobin and also for body aches is low hemoglobin and low vitamin D. Your ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) is elevated which is due to low hemoglobin (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your thyroid is fine. So you should have Iron supplements like tablet Fericip XT (Iron and Folic acid) twice a day after breakfast and after dinner. This may cause some gastritis.

"Hello doctor,How eating habits or certain foods impact sleep? How much should men be stretching at 25, 30, 35, 40, 45? Does the need to be flexible vary by age?","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Eating late heavy dinners will certainly affect sleep and also missing the meal altogether. Should avoid fatty meal especially at dinner time. Meals taken with lots of fluids are to be avoided too. Men should try and remain as flexible as possible, really more stiff, you are more likelihood of osteoarthritis setting in, more likelihood of injuries. Aim to continue with stretches for as long as possible."
"Hello doctor,My baby is 10 months old, and he is two months premature. If I feed him with solid food, he does vomiting. Is it not safe for him to feed with solid food?","Hello. I just read your query. I advise you to try giving some soft and semi-solid foods to your baby right now. Once he starts digesting these then move on slowly towards other food items. Moreover, some babies do not take solid food properly until they develop teeth. But if your baby does not digest semi-solid foods too, then you need to visit a nearby child specialist. Because it can be due to some other underlying cause which needs to be ruled out. I hope you understand my point."
"Hello doctor,I am 23, 51 kg. I had unprotected sex a day before I got my period (on the 38th day of cycle). It lasted for four days (normal). Today is the 13th day from when my period started and I am getting bad backache, my breasts hurt (usually happens just before period) and sticky egg white discharge. Am I pregnant or is it ovulation? I had taken a pregnancy test before I got my period because I was late and it was negative. I have mild PCOS. So, my periods are never on time but happens every month. Is it possible to be pregnant after you get your period?","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I have gone through your history and understand your concern. This is very unlikely to be pregnancy as a proper period followed and when UPT (urine pregnancy test) was negative just before the period. So, you are at present not pregnant and no chances of pregnancy even with that last unprotected intercourse. The nature of discharge is suggestive of ovulation only. However, if still any doubt in your mind you may take two pregnancy tests - one immediately now and another after a week. If both are negative, you are not pregnant.

"Hello doctor,I am 32 years old and had an herinated disc and had surgery a few years back, it was a post delayed surgery. Due to the delay in surgery (18 days) I left with a foot drop and right leg weakness. I was bedridden for 4 months. Totally weak. But I gradually developed doing physiotheraphy and with some Ayurvedic treatment. I started waking now with out any help. But my foot drop is still there. But I can lift my toe and ankle little bit from last month. Can I come to my normal life, how long I need to wait to get cured from foot drop?","Hello. I can advise you in detail if i have your detailed neurological charting including assessment of motor power, sensory charting of lower limbs and evaluation of deep tendon reflexes. Also, latest MRI of LS spine is required to see for adequacy of decompression.  To answer your query, the best results come early after the spinal decompression surgery, if motor loss can be ascribed to compression in spinal cord or roots. Also intensive physical therapy helps you to gain power . But since you have started gaining power, it can continue for at least 6 more months, so my advise to you will be to continue with intensive physical therapy including muscle stimulation, vitamin B12 intake and come back to me with your neurological charting and MRI films so that i can see and advise you further."
"Hello doctor,I was at the dentist yesterday and had a gum cleaning and now today there are 2 bumps in the back of my mouth on top and my gums right there also look red and there more looking like balls per say.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I have been through your query and I can understand your concern. The feeling of strange, weird and sometimes loose tooth are major complaints that a patient generally comes with, after having the cleaning (scaling and root planing) done. This is because of the removal of the debris. Earlier what would have become normal for the patient is now removed (debris) and the patient interprets it somewhat as loose tooth and strange feeling. The redness you are referring to is the erythmatous tissue that generally occurs post cleaning because the gums while cleaning gets separated from the tooth structure (like an injury). However, the healing capacity of gums is very fast and it would be go in 3-4 days. Referring to the picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity), the bumps you are saying, you do not need to worry about. As also you are saying that there is no pain means they are not infected. They might have occured due to the injury of hard palate during cleaning. I would suggest you to not worry as they are generally seen after cleaning is done. They would be gone after some days (generally 3-4 days). However, if the bumps persists beyond one week, I would advise you to have a visit to your nearest dentist for proper and overall examination. Moreover, I would suggest you to keep maintaining good oral hygiene by brushing twice daily and floss regularly. Also rinse your mouth with oral rinses for 4 days a week and 3 weeks a month. I hope I have satisfied you with my answer."

The condition that you mentioned can arise due to a variety of causes. You have not suggested whether it is associated with pain, burning sensation or itching. Let me name a few conditions where the milky white appearance on the tongue is generally seen. 1. Candidiasis associated is with pain and burning sensation at times. Can be scraped off the tongue. Usually occurs in diabetics. 2. Leukoplakia is non-scrappable, painless but can progress to cancerous condition if not treated early. 3. Oral lichen planus is associated with a burning sensation, pain may or may not be present. People with a poor immune system are usually prone. These are the conditions. But be relaxed. It is completely curable. Make sure you see your doctor as early as possible and have the condition diagnosed. Early intervention and prompt treatment is the best solution.  Take care."
"Hello doctor,I am 29 years old . I am married from the last 1.5 years. My problem is that from the last two weeks I am am not getting proper erection during sex. Erection comes a bit and goes out instantly. It is just happeing from the last two weeks before that I was totally fine. I am taking some herbal medicines. Please suggest me why this happening to me. Right now I cat get any erection sex only a bit if I watch some porn or like that. I am having so much tension because of that. Yes one more thing, I used to take one penis size enlarge oil but very rarely. Might be because of that oil I am having this problem. Please suggest me best possible option to cure this.",Hi. I can understand your concern. As you are getting erections when you watch porn but are losing during sex this shows that problem is not organic. The issues are more psychological. Confido helps to boost confidence but is not proper treatment. For some times you can try tablet Tadalafil or Sildenafil. Either of these tablets if taken about half to one hour before sexual intercourse help to improve erection.  If problem persists then visit a doctor and get serum Testosterone and Prolactin levels done. If levels of both these hormones come normal then remain relaxed. No need to worry.
"Hello doctor,I will be facing major surgery for stage three lung cancer contained in the left lobe. I am extremely allergic to Fentanyl, Propofol, and Versed. Are there any alternatives to these anesthetics? I am currently on Synthroid.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. If you are allergic to these agents, I suggest you undergo a detailed allergy test with various agents so that you will be able to know which agents are safer for you. There are so many agents and techniques available nowadays in the field of anesthesia. If you are allergic to Propofol, Thiopentone (Sodium Thiopental) or Etomidate is a safer option. For analgesia, the multimodal technique will be a safer option including regional anesthesia, various blocks, NSAIDS, etc. Versed (Midazolam) can be avoided at all during surgery. So my suggestion to you is to inform your anesthetist about this and leave your worries on him."
"Hello doctor,I have rheumatoid arthritis. There is a long waiting list to see a rheumatologist in my place. I am thinking of seeing a private doctor but I have limited funds. How often would I need to see a rheumatologist? I cannot afford it every week or maybe every few months. How often do you think I need a doctor visit? I am hoping to be prescribed a DMARD like Methotrexate. Then when my slot comes up with the NHS I will go there.I take Naproxen which is not enough and I had a cortisone injection in my knee a couple of months ago. The swelling did not go down completely but I walked better. It has worn off now, and I have pain in more joints and a feeling of lumps under my feet. I am on a special diet and my CRP, ESR and high rheumatoid factor have gone down by half. But lately, I feel unwell. I would like to know the frequency of visits needed.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I have gone through your history. The only part I did not get was, that how come there have been no DMARDs (disease-modifying anti-rheumatic  ChatDoctor.  It is a bit unusual. If you could throw some light on the history of arthritis, it would be helpful. If it was an intermittent one initially, or now it has become persistent? Well, as per the treatment, if it is confirmed rheumatoid arthritis, they will start you on Methotrexate straight away. The follow-up visits are usually within four to six weeks for the first time, and then after three months. But a lot depends on your treating rheumatologist. Most of them advise liver function tests after two weeks to see if the dose is not giving you side effects. But that can usually be followed up with rheumatology nurse. So once you are through with first visit and improvement comes, then a three months visit suffices. But if the disease keeps bouncing back, then a bit more frequent visits are needed. But hardly before six weeks as that much time, it takes for any new DMARD to act. So it is a bit tough to predict, but do not worry. No rheumatologist will call you back in a week or two. I hope this helps."

As I was digging, the pain started hurting with each heartbeat. I looked at my monitor and it read 138 bpm. I am 70 years old and have been on medication (Benzodiazepines) for over 50 years for panic attacks and general anxiety. Two years ago I felt similar pain but not to this extent.

There is not much of difference between asthma and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). COPD is usually seen in a person who has smoked a lot while asthma is seen from childhood, which is not in your case. Acid reflux can cause prolonged duration cough, but it shall subside very well once treated for acid reflux. But in your case, it has persisted. So it has to be either COPD or infection of the lung.

"Hello doctor,I am a 28-year-old man with very less facial hair. Recent blood check-up shows that my DHEAS value is 195.9. Insulin check-up indicates that there is a high chance of becoming a diabetic patient. My doctor suggested me Ashwagandha, and I have been taking it for a month (two capsules per day). Not much gain. So, I would like to take DHEA supplements for beard growth, is it fine?","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I think it is very normal to have less hair on the face. Even if you have little hairs, it is normal. Do not worry about your DHEAS level. You should not be taking any hormonal treatment unless it is required and so you can consult an endocrinologist for it. If you have normal sexual functioning, you should not worry about it. If it bothers you too much, you can ask a hair transplant surgeon and get a nice beard transplant. Focus on a healthy diet and regular exercise."

Your symptoms are suggestive of upper gastrointestinal intestinal bleed. Please stop Meloxicam 15 mg tablet immediately. I suggest you take proton pump inhibitor medication like Omeprazole 40 mg tablet straightaway and take preferably cold water. Please check with an accident and emergency department for further care for intravenous proton pump inhibitor, antiemetic medications, and further lab investigations such as complete blood count, bleeding and clotting time, prothrombin time with platelets, APTT (activated partial thromboplastin time), INR (international normalized ratio), stool for occult blood, ultrasound abdomen, complete liver function tests to assess the extent of blood loss through stools. In case of evidence of ongoing bleed, you will require packed cells and urgent upper GI endoscopy for diagnosis and stapling of bleeding esophageal varices. Do not take Aspirin tablets or any other painkillers as they can worsen bleeding inside the gut. Stop alcohol, spicy diet, coffee, and tea.  After emergency treatment, I suggest the long list of medications be reviewed to see whether it can be simplified. For more information consult a general practitioner online"
"Hi doctor,I took the first abortion pill but until now, I did not get bleed. What is the reason?","Hello. It is really a very short description of your concern. It would be better if you would send me your detailed gynecological, menstrual, obstetric, medical and other histories. Which pill have you taken and how much dose? Had you confirmed your pregnancy status before having the pill? If not, have serum beta hCG (blood pregnancy test) to have a clear idea about your pregnancy. On which date have you taken the pill and what was your last period date? If pregnancy is confirmed and it is early pregnancy, emergency contraceptive pills give with ChatDoctor.  Kindly send me your details so that I can guide you. In case of a positive pregnancy test, check again the level of beta hCG after 48 hours from the previous test. It will give us a clear idea about pregnancy progression or the effect of the pill on it as well. If the second level comes less than the previous it is a miscarriage. If the second level shows increase more than 60 % then it is a normal growing pregnancy. If the second level shows less then 60 % increase it is alarming and you need a transvaginal scan to exclude pregnancy outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy). In case of pain, bleeding, dizziness with a positive pregnancy test, better to report to a tertiary care unit. For more information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online"
"Hello doctor,I am a 23-year-old male. I have no symptoms and I am not taking any current medication. Three years ago I once went to the hospital because I felt my heart was beating really fast, and they did some EKG scans and a blood test on me saying that everything is normal. They also gave me the Holter monitor and when they checked the results they said this was normal. I do not smoke or drink alcohol maybe three times a year I will drink. I used to do some shisha but that has stopped for the past three years.Since then I have never been to a hospital for the health of my heart. However, since then, my heartbeat has just been higher than everyone else but I do not get headaches or any other symptoms. I used to stress a lot. However, things are going well now and it has cut down. I wake up at times during the night but fall back asleep very easily. I have done gym and dance classes for over a year and I feel fine when working out.I went to the GP just a week ago due to my girlfriend having some concerns. I asked them to do a regular check and they said my heartbeat at that moment was 98 and he said this was fine. However, my girlfriend gets really worried about this and feels that something will happen to me. She just needs some medical advice in order to get her the assurance. She has been checking online for some answers and it is said stuff like arrhythmia, tachycardia, etc. She also says that the normal is between 80-100 bpm and why is mine on the top end? Is it a serious cause? Or does heart and pulse rate vary? Also, I have been checking the prevalence of heart diseases, etc., online and it is very rare for someone at my age.

There could be one of the two possibilities, either your testis has not developed at all or it has developed normally but has failed to move into the scrotum. At your age, if your sexual desire is normal and your secondary sexual characteristics like facial hair, pubic hair growth is normal then your testosterone production is normal. Your reproductive ability will depend on the number of sperms produced by your normal testis.

"Hello doctor,I am a 22 years old woman. My period got delayed by 20 days. I had intercourse with my partner. I have mild pain in my abdomen and there is brownish vaginal discharge. I took urine test and a faint pink line along with a strong pink line appeared. Am I pregnant? If so what medication should I take to avoid pregnancy? Also, if I take a blood test now, will it be more accurate?","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. A faint pink line does not confirm pregnancy. The dark line is for control. As your period is late by 20 days both lines should be dark, you can repeat the test after five days but if you have too much pain then you will need to do ultrasound test of the pelvis or transvaginal ultrasound. Without confirming or excluding pregnancy no medicine should be taken, it may harm you. Also, if the beta hCG level is in the pregnancy range then it will confirm. Otherwise, you will need to repeat the test after two days to see if the level is rising or not. That will be more accurate. For more information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online"

She will need ultrasound pelvis for uterus and ovaries, and hormonal profile like thyroid function test, serum FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) and LH (luteinizing hormone). She should visit a gynecologist once for examination and for these investigations. Medicine could be initiated after ruling out the pregnancy and finding the cause. I hope this helps."

The sensitivity and mild pain are due to inflammation around the teeth. Follow these medications. Take tablet Acelofenac 100 mg along with Paracetamol 500 mg two times a day for five days. It reduces the swelling, and it helps to stabilize the teeth back in the socket. If it is not more mobile, then it will get healed soon within 15 days.

I do not see any reason for you to worry. The movement of egg into the fallopian tube is chemically controlled or attracted. So, no matter which tube is open or blocked, the egg falls into the peritoneal cavity or the space around the uterus. Then, it will be obviously sucked into the open tube. So, you have definitely a chance of pregnancy. Your doctor will have more job to do only after you get pregnant, with lots of close monitoring and medications.

"Hello doctor,My right side jaw is paining while having food. On consultation, I was advised for physiotherapy. What could be the reason for it?","Hello. There might be several issues expected, 1. As you mentioned if there is only jawline problem, then you should have physiotherapy and warm massage at TM joints (tempero mandibular) at the junction of the ear when you open your mouth, it can be felt quickly. Do warm massage for 10 days, twice a day this will relieve symptoms definitely if it is because of the joint. Try not to yawn or open your mouth big, do eat with a spoon, do not have rice with hand. These will relieve jaw pain. 2. If the symptoms do not get better with massage and exercise, and you are having pain in some tooth, then you might be having some infection in the tooth that needs root canal treatment or extraction. If you can provide me with OPG X-ray of your jaw, I can tell you the exact diagnosis and the treatment plan. Tell me about symptoms as well, do you feel more pain at night as compared to day time? Are you feeling hot and cold sensations? Tell me details so I could figure out the root cause of your pain.   Take care."

You may put up some clear pictures of the affected area for proper evaluation and guidance."

If nothing is found and every report comes normal, then she will be given some medicines accordingly. And no need to worry. If something is found in the reports, then it may require major operations, but it will all depend on the reports. So first, consult a nearby gynecologist."

The next morning my belly button is out half an inch. My surgeon said just wait for a couple of days to see if it goes back down. I need to know if I should wait or get in right away. The belly button is a little tender.","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  As it has been only 10 days since your surgery, I suggest you wait for a few more days and see your surgeon if necessary. It is quite likely that there may be a small collection of fluid in the region which may get absorbed or may need aspiration. It is quite unlikely to have a recurrence so soon unless the surgery did not go well. If the swelling appears on coughing or straining it may suggest a recurrence. It is best tested by the surgeon as attempting the same at home may precipitate a recurrence. Take adequate rest. Be active. Take a good diet. Avoid straining or lifting weight for at least six months. See your surgeon if it still persists next week. I hope this helps."

"Hello doctor,If I get my wisdom teeth extracted, do my second molars shift in that empty spot?","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. No, it will not shift to the empty space, but it might tilt and that too very little. Because the third molar is vestigial. If you have any associated problem with the third molar you can extract it.

Also giving me a slight headache and earache. I recently went to the dentist for a cleaning, and they said my wisdom teeth were not even showing so what could this be?","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum.

Is there something else besides the vomiting that could have caused the bruised eyelids?","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. From the history provided, it seems that your friend is having red and bruised eyes following vomiting.

Hence, you need not have to worry about this.Applying cold compression over the eyelids will provide symptomatic relief.

"Hi doctor,I am a 19-year-old female. I lost my virginity about 10 months ago with my boyfriend. Now after 10 months has passed I found out that I have two warts inside my vagina. It is white color although, the one on the top started to have a slight pink color. But the second one on the bottom which is much smaller still has completely white color and around the vagina blades, I have a little while dots.

Now I have a few questions. Is this mean I have an HPV virus inside my body? How can I make the virus go away permanently? Will Gardasil injection make it go away? If it does not go away permanently, how can I make sure that I have no HPV viruses and so these warts will not come back again? Is this mean that I have this HPV from my boyfriend?

My daily dose is 32.5 units Lantus at 10 AM and 12.5 units at 8 PM, with a sliding scale for Novolog (typically 0 to 6 units).

I can tell you right away that your type 1 DM (diabetes mellitus) is not being managed correctly. Those who have type 1 DM cannot make it without basal insulin so insulin it has to be provided 24/7. You should be on balanced Lantus and scheduled Novolog (and not sliding scale of Novolog- Insulin aspart). You can take Novolog but it has to be every 3 to 4 hours, and it has to be scheduled. Also, you need to check your blood sugar every 3 to 4 hours before taking a shot, that is a must. You will run into very high or very low blood sugar and will see an erratic pattern, you will have to adjust the dose accordingly. Watch and check your ketones 2 to 3 times daily, should not stay without Lantus (Insulin glargine) for more than 24 hours.  Novolog dose at least should be seven units every four hours (calculated from your current regimen you should need at least 1.8 units of Insulin every hour to survive).

Had angio done approximately two years ago due to suspected heart attack or arrhythmia at home with all classic signs crushing chest pain jaw neck left arm down to the floor nauseated?Even with that lab test came back good the next day. Had carotid artery surgery two years ago to remove a piece of plaque in right carotid artery none found anywhere else no stent needed. Again all labs are good cholesterol not high on statins and warfarin. I must be perplexing to all doctors because they cannot figure it out. Was put on warfarin approximately 15 years ago due to DVTs as a result of a surgery, always therapeutic.

"Hi doctor,I am a 49-year-old woman and last month I was hospitalized with a necrotizing soft tissue infection on my thigh. I had two debridement surgeries and was discharged after 5 days. I was treated with about 4 IV antibiotics. I do not remember them all, I recall seeing Vancomycin and Penicillin. I was told that the infection was not MRSA, but a \""slower moving bacteria\"" they did not tell me what it was. I was swabbed for MRSA in my nose and butt before both surgeries and was told I did not have it. For the last day of my stay, I had a roommate who had a bad MRSA infection on her butt and sometimes had diarrhea incontinence during dressing changes. I had no physical contact with her, but we had the same nurse. I was discharged with a five day course of Augmentin.The wound has been healing very well and has not gotten infected, but three weeks after discharge I got an abscess under my arm. I went to an urgent care and was prescribed Clindamycin and told to return in three days for drainage. The abscess did not improve or get worse over the three days. I got it drained and was prescribed Augmentin and told to also continue the clindamycin. That was a week ago and the wound is healing well. They called today and said cultures show it was MRSA and they prescribed Bactrim and told me to stop the other antibiotics.I am feeling devastated by this and wanting to understand why it happened. Could I have gotten it in the hospital? I am concerned that it will not go away. Are those swabs at the hospital conclusive and mean for sure I did not have MRSA a month ago? I have never had any medical problems before and these experiences have been very frightening. Is there anything else I can do to prevent recurrence? I have read about everything from bleach baths and hibiclens to antibiotics in the nose.","Hi, I am sorry for what you have had to go through. As you previously did not have MRSA strains, it is possible that now you have hospital-acquired strains in your blood. It is a superbug and superdifficult to treat as it is resistant to  ChatDoctor.  As you were told to stop other antibiotics and start Bactrim, this means the strain you have got is sensitive to Bactrim. If there is anything else you want to ask, please feel free to contact me."
"Hello doctor,I am a sufferer of hemiplegic migraine. However, I had unusual collapses three months back. The first one was 40 minutes; I could not recall the whole of that period. I came back with an injured knee and felt dazed. I was fine after around two hours. The next day, I felt pressure in my head and as though I was about to die. I then could not recall getting home or the rest of the night. I was fine in the morning. Two days later, I felt horrendous pain in my head, felt like I was swimming, then tried to go home and again could not recall from deciding to go home to around two hours later and I was foggy for the rest of the night. I have had constant pain in the left side of my head above the temple for four years. It does not go. However, In the past two weeks, I have felt like it is throbbing and at times about to burst out. I was meant to see my neurologist three months back, but his receptionist did not follow the recommendation, and now I am unsure whether to have the tests done. I feel like we are playing with my life. Usually, I am pretty relaxed about the possibilities and know it is a migraine. But this feels different. This feels like intense throbbing above my ear from the temple along towards the back of my head, with a pain in my ear to just behind my jaw under my ear. My instinct says that an aneurysm needs ruling out. I do not know if I am just upset because it feels so different and this pressure is intense. It is a weird feeling. I currently take Sumatriptan as needed.Please, can you advise what to do? As it stands the next neuro appointment is after four months, added complication is that I have been breathless and unable to climb stairs without stopping and panting for past four months. I am having heart tests on the weekend. But, what do I do about my brain?","Hello. I agree with you on the fact that when dealing with hemiplegic migraine, it is necessary excluding a brain aneurysm or any arterio-venous malformation, which may mimic this clinical situation. That is why it is necessary performing a brain MRI, which would detect any possible brain aneurysm if present. Regarding the loss of conscience, I would also recommend performing an EEG (electroencephalogram) to investigate for seizures (although 40 minutes is a long period for a seizure, not typical). I would also recommend you to monitor your blood pressure values, and perform some blood laboratory tests as follows"

As I am a patient of PCOD, will I be able to conceive in the future? Will I be given some hormonal treatment to conceive later? Please advise me whether I should proceed with the idea of egg donation. Is there any chance of developing breast or ovarian cancer if I donate eggs? Please guide me. I just want to know about its long term consequences as I am afraid of breast and ovarian cancer.","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. A single cycle of ovulation induction for egg donation and then, possibly in the future for yourself would not increase your chance of breast or ovarian cancer. The heredity for a woman is decided from her maternal background and not from the father\\s side. So, if your paternal aunt had it and your mother or maternal grandmother did not have it, then there are very minimal chances that you should get it in future. You can safely go ahead with an ova donation if you wish to without fear. PCOS - polycystic ovary syn ChatDoctor.

Out of 10 nails, six nails have one-third of the nails separated from the nail beds, with a v shape, looking white underneath, rest of the nails are looking pinkish pale. The nails are painless unless I press them hard. All the nails have some ridges. I kept my nails short with no polish for over five weeks. My fingers felt dry with mild skin peeling after a travel.

At your age, chronic constipation should be thoroughly investigated. Are there any other symptoms like blood in stool, weight loss, or occasional diarrhea alternating with constipation or loss of appetite?

"Hello doctor, My question is, when can I drink more than two glasses of wine a day or a whole bottle without it hindering the healing process after my dermapen session of micro needling? And also, because I was occasionally drinking a few bottles of beer after I had gotten it done, does that mean my healing time has to be longer than six weeks? By the way, I did my acne scar regions with 2.00 mm needles.","Hi. Alcohol use can diminish wound healing, it increases the blood flow so it can also cause bleeding. Excessive alcohol intake also reduces the immunity of the body which can lead to delayed wound healing. Same principle applied to micro needling. Micro needling is also a small type of injuries created in the facial skin so that the healing process makes a healthy smooth skin and remove the scar. So if you take alcohol during that process alcohol is going to affect that healing process and it can lead to infection. So I advise that you should completely avoid alcohol if possible. A small amount of one glass of beer per day can be taken if you cannot control your urge to take alcohol. I hope this helps."

Let me clarify that double marker is only a screening test .It\\s not a confirmatory test.

It means even if we say ,ur second test shows a high risk (chances of which r less) ,it only means that this baby for some reason has a higher risk for a genetic problem.you still need to do an amniocentesis and do a karyotyping to confirm the genetic problem. We see many double markers which r abnormal,but very few if those have an abnormal Karyotype on confirmation.

"Hi doctor,I had a frenuloplasty of the penis ten days back. It all seemed fine at first, and I had very little pain. I have to say the actual incision and stitches were a lot larger than what I was previously led to believe. I have been washing gently with salt water and rinsing twice daily. I took a good look a few days ago, and it seems that the stitches have come apart. To be honest, and I am not a urologist, but it does not look like a good job, though I may be wrong. I went to see the doctor yesterday, and she took a look and said that it all looks fine, the stitches may have come apart slightly. She told me to leave it for two weeks, and if I am still concerned, they will refer me back to the specialist.

"Hello doctor,I often have elbow pain due to spending more time with computer and using a mouse or keyboard. I work 7 to 8 hours daily in computer and pain is gradually increasing.

It happens due to excessive use of muscle which causes stretch over the tendon at the origin giving rise to pain.

Next thing, you should support your elbow as much as possible during use of computer like keeping on the edge of the chair or using pillows or some other support so as to reduce stress. Also, rather than any medicines, you should use sleeves or brace as much as possible. If not adequately helpful then may have a local Voveran gel (Diclofenac). Tablet Voveran should be avoided as much as possible, and only have if absolutely painful. Tendoshot (Chon ChatDoctor. ) you may have. In painkillers, if you need, safest is Paracetamol like tablet Dolo 650 or Ultracet if it is not helpful then comes Voveran. You may use hot water fomentation.

"Hello doctor,My wife was previously diagnosed with bipolar II and was taking 100 mg Lamotrigine daily for depression maintenance. She was on that dosage for nine years.

She tapered off the Lamotrigine, which was very difficult.It has been three to four weeks since her last dose of Lamotrigine, and nine weeks since her infusions. She is feeling very moody and depressed, irritability, fatigue, loss of focus. The question is, do you think she needs to go back on the Lamotrigine?

"Hello doctor,For almost a week now I have had recurring random pain just behind both of my ear lobes. It has been almost three weeks since I stopped Lyrica, Pregabalin completely for back pain.

So, is it possible to get back that previous size if I follow any instructions advised by you? I do not drink or smoke.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Masturbation is a safe habit and it does not cause any serious effects on health. Masturbation is not a cause for the reduced size of the penis. Size of penis remains constant and it never decreases. If you are seeing any reduction in size, then that is due to psychological reasons. If you have a normal erection then no need to get worried. Size has no roles in sexual intercourse. Jelqing is an exercise that can help in improving the size. You can think of trying this. This involves milking like repetitive action in a semi-erected penis. This will help in improving the size of the penis to some extent."

"Hello doctor,I had unprotected oral sex with a CSW. I ejaculated in her mouth. She ran quickly to spit. I do not know if she was HIV positive or not. Should I be worried about my health?","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Unprotected receptive oral sex is safer than unprotected vaginal or anal sex but not entirely safe. There is a negligible risk of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and other STDs (sexually transmitted diseases) like herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis. The risk is more if the person had oral sores or bleeding gums. For more information consult an HIV AIDS specialist online"

"Hi doctor,I have flaky skin on my scalp. My doctor told me it is sebopsoriasis. The flaking is limited to the scalp, and my doctor has prescribed Folitrax 5 mg and Aprezo 30 mg. I am having this problem for about four to five years. I am able to control flaking in the scalp by washing with shampoo but, it reoccurs after a day with hair loss. Can it be controlled? Or can it spread to other parts of the body?","Hi. I have gone through the query. Yes, it can be controlled with medications. But, unfortunately, you may experience frequent exacerbations due to stress or steroids or specific medicine or due to a sore throat.

Please suggest what is this? And how I can clear this?","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I understand your concern. It looks to me like lichen planus or vasculitis. But skin biopsy is required to confirm the diagnosis. For that, you need to visit a skin specialist in person. If you have lesions anywhere else on the body, send pictures of them too. Meanwhile, use the following medications. 1. Tacvido Forte 0.1 % (Tacrolimus) ointment apply twice a day for three weeks."

I have no symptoms other than it will fall off as time pasts and grow back itself. I was wondering what would it be as I am worried if that is some kind of melanoma?","Hi,  Welcome to ChatDoctor. I have seen your query and examined your given picture. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  It seems you have developed seborrheic keratosis or a mole.

"Hello doctor,When I was 11 years old, I was knocked off my bike and cracked my front tooth in half horizontally, shortly after the dentist fixed it. Since then I have had no problems with it and had multiple x-rays to check on it. When it happened, the color of the tooth changed very slightly, to a very slightly more yellow shade than the rest of my teeth. I am curious to know what happened when the trauma occurred. Did my tooth die? What are they checking for when they x-ray the tooth?","Hello. I have been through your query and can understand your concern. Any trauma to the tooth generally has long-term consequences like tooth discoloration, etc. As you said that your tooth was fractured, it might have led to a slight injury to the pulp or even if not so, the fracture line would have been close to the pulp. In both cases, the pulp over time starts to become non-vital sometimes due to injury and sometimes due to the restorative material lying in close proximity to the pulp. This over time results in the discoloration of the tooth. The characteristic feature of this discoloration will be that only the involved tooth will be discolored and other teeth will be normal or not discolored. If that is the case, it generally means that the tooth is in the process of becoming non-vital till the tooth becomes slight brownish black which means the tooth is entirely non-vital. It is generally not associated with any kind of pain as the process is chronic and takes time to set in. I would advise you to have a visit to your nearest dentist. He would prescribe a vitality test of the tooth and also would get an x-ray for the tooth. By that way, he would come to know if the tooth is dead or still vital and accordingly will propose treatment. If the tooth is vital, he will put some medication over the pulp to let it heal and then fill with the pulp friendly restoration. However, if the tooth is dead, I would suggest you to go for the root canal treatment (after evaluating the condition of the tooth and soft tissue). Meanwhile, keep your oral hygiene good, brush twice daily and floss regularly. Use mouth rinses to clean the mouth after meals."
"Hi doctor,I have been wearing braces for teeth alignment. I am towards the end of my treatment and have developed a high pitched sound in my right ear. I consulted with my orthodontist and temporarily removed the wires on two occasions. Both times, the ringing went down after some weeks. When I put on again, the sound started. One ENT I consulted said it could be an allergy to dust in the area I live in. Based on the information I received and the symptoms, I am not sure how to proceed. What is the cause of this issue?","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Tinnitus due to braces is not possible. Tinnitus can be due to many reasons like hearing loss, or nerve loss, or any loud noise exposure, or trauma to the ear, or even nasal infection, or some medicines. Please tell me do you have any relevant history? Dental procedures that involve the use of dental burs can cause tinnitus but not just the braces. You should get pure tone audiometry done and follow up with the required information so that I can suggest you better."

"Hello doctor,I am a 41-year-old female and have been diagnosed with viral conjunctivitis by a specialist. My eye health is otherwise perfect (had them checked out a week before this came on). After a few days, it spread to the other eye. I expect the first eye will heal first, even though the second eye is not as bad. One question is when the first eye heals, do I need to protect it from re-infection from the one that is still healing?Also, on the typical length of healing, I am not quite at two weeks yet (this is day 11 for the first eye), but the lack of improvement in my condition is becoming frustrating to me. Today the vision in the first eye is smudgy, and the vision in the second eye is better, but not perfect. The specialist was aware of the vision problems, and she said that it was normal (though I think they have worsened).I was told this could take weeks to heal, beyond the normal one or two. How many weeks are weeks generally? I was told I have a mild to moderate case, but all I know is that I have seen no real progress, and I think the virus might have even spread to one of my sinuses. My mental health is suffering from not knowing how long I am going to be cooped up, partially visually impaired and contagious. Am I impatient or should I have them looked at by a specialist again?","Hello. I reviewed your history. It seems from the history that you are having viral conjunctivitis involving both the eyes. Coming to your first question, viral conjunctivitis remains infective in the initial three to five days hence no need to worry about the reinfection from the one eye that is still healing. Usually, viral conjunctivitis follows a self-limiting course of 7 to 10 days. Since you are having vision problems in the eye, probably it has involved cornea resulting in viral keratoconjunctivitis.  If it has involved the cornea, it takes about three to four weeks to heal. However, the involvement of cornea is not because of infection, but because of immunologically mediated reaction, hence it will resolve even without treatment. However, symptomatic relief can be obtained by using artificial tears, and some severe cases may require the use of steroid eye  ChatDoctor.  If possible, send a photo of the affected eye so that I can confirm the diagnosis and answer your question more accurately. I hope the information is helpful to you.  Take care."

Should I try again for a new third root canal? What about periodontitis which is at the beginning?","Hello. At first, I appreciate you because you have so much awareness of your oral health. The life span of normal root canal treated tooth is 5 to 6 years. If you have 15-year-old treated tooth, it means you are so health conscious and take care of your oral hygiene. My opinion is you should go for extraction along with cyst removal because third-time root canal of the same tooth is not a good idea. Periodontitis is nothing but an infection of gum tissue which is totally curable and depends upon your oral hygiene. Bone resorption is a kind of bone loss due to demineralization. There are many things which are responsible for that like age factor, some diseases, calcium level, gingivitis with periodontitis is also a cause of bone loss."
"Hi doctor,This is in regards to my daughter who is 5 years old. Four days back suddenly she developed a fever. Fever was around 100 degrees F. Yesterday her fever subsided and now she does not have the same. She did not have a cough, cold, etc. But she lost appetite and she also had left eye white area red. The redness also has disappeared now. She did complain of a little bit of nausea and headache. But yesterday everything subsided and she recovered well. But, yesterday night we saw red bumps around her face, forehead and chest area. It itches sometimes. I am attaching the image for your reference. These bumps are slightly raised. Rest she seems fine now. Her appetite has increased as well.On the second day of her fever, she fainted briefly (a little bit of saliva came out from her mouth) for 5 to 10 seconds. She recovered quickly in a minute or two. This happened in the early morning when she woke up and stood. She had moderately high fever throughout the night.","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. It is urticaria. It happens commonly in chil ChatDoctor.  In your daughter's case, that patient may develop this kind of rashes. It will need 5 to 7 days antihistaminics. Tablet Xyzal 5 mg daily for seven days. It is safe and does not have any major or common side effects. It will be fine in 1 to 2 doses but stop it after 5 to 7 days later. As the baby is otherwise fine, no need of other investigations at this moment. But I would like to highlight a point to you that, the possibility of recurrent episodes may be there in future. Whenever it happens you may take Xyzal (Levocetirizine) in an emergency but consult the doctor too without much delay.  For more information consult a dermatologist online"
"Hello doctor,I tore off a mole or a freckle some weeks ago and now the surface, it is like this. Is it good or should I worry? What are those red spots?","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I have gone through your case. Your lesion is active which means the area has not healed after removing your mole (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Keep applying Fucidin acid cream two times a day till red area disappears. It is not something to be worried for as such raw areas take some time to recover. But no opinion can be given for lesion or mole or freckle which you have removed yourself. It could be a simple mole or it could be a wart. Such raw areas are usually seen after wart scratching."
"Hello doctor,I have some irregularly textured skin on my face that are not even visible if you are not trying to find them. Are they scars or damaged pores? Also, I have been using Dapsone for a month now and have applied BP 205 and Adapalene 0.1 in the past. Can these cause such texture damage? And what is the red part (encircled), is it PIH or something else? Also does Adapalene 0.1 alond with Clindamycin 1 improves skin texture?","Hi. You have post inflammatory hyperpigmentation with minute acne scars that are very few (attachment removed to protect patient identity). For PIH (post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation) you can use Aziderm (Azelaic acid) 20 % gel in the morning. For acne scars, you can continue Adapalene 0.1 % gel at night. If you want you can go for chemical peeling and derma roller."
"Hello doctor,I am a 24 year old male. Last year, I had a few molluscum contagiosum in my lower abdomen. I took the treatment, and they were gone. After two to three months, I got one skin tag on the skin around my penis. I applied a lotion (Salicylic acid 16.7% and Lactic acid 16.7%), and the skin tag was removed. But, it came back after three months. Currently, I am suffering from genital warts and taking treatment.My doctor told me to get some test and here are the results. Lipid profile - triglycerides 125 mg/dL, HDL 35 mg/dL and LDL 113 mg/dL, CBC - lymphocyte 44%, serum amylase 121 IU/L, Helicobacter pylori IgA 0.45 (negative) and urine test - pus cells 3 to 4/HPF. Currently, I am taking these medicine as advised by my doctor. Zincolak one tablet twice daily, Zycolchin one tablet twice daily and Dicaris 150 mg one tablet once a day for three days.My question is that I am a healthy man with high immunity. I never get sick all around the year. How did I catch this infection? I have multiple sex partner, but I never had sex without a condom, or my condom never broke. Please give me a detailed answer and also give me advice for the treatment.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Warts and molluscum are common sexually acquired infections and can occur in healthy individuals. Warts spread by touch and condoms will only protect the covered area. Base of the penis, thighs, lower abdomen are all exposed. So, both warts and molluscum can be transmitted even with condom usage. For treatment, I suggest you Imiquimod 5% cream. Apply it over the affected area thrice a week and leave it overnight and wash in the morning. Use it for 16 weeks. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take treatment with consent. Also, you should get tested for HIV and hepatitis."

This is a condition in which the foreskin gets trapped behind the glans penis (head of the penis) and does not return back to its original position when pulled. This induces pain.

"Hi doctor,I know a patient who is having hypertension. The doctor has prescribed Losalife H in the morning and Losalex 50 in the night. Is this an excess dose or is it normal?","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. It depends entirely on the extent of BP (blood pressure) elevation. Usually, most of the patients become well on once-daily dosing. But in some patients, we need twice daily dosing. So often, once daily is enough. But if the BP is not getting controlled or there is too high elevation say more than 190 mmHg, then we can give twice daily dosing. So the best option, in this case, is monitoring the BP at home using electronic BP apparatus and have the dosing accordingly. Let me know the BP readings if available so that I can suggest the treatment. So overall, if it is a need, a twice-daily dose can be taken."

In gallbladder disease, symptoms are more important. So, if you do not have any symptoms then there is nothing to worry.

"Hello doctor,I am having back pain. Six months ago I had S1 and L5 fusion. Normally, no surgery or anything. My doctor asked me to take rest. Then two months back I was again having pain in my back and no findings from my X-ray. Then I did an MRI four days back when I was having pain in my legs mainly in the thigh, calf, and foot. The pain is continuous. It is not resting for a minute, but the amount of pain varies sometimes a lot sometimes a little.I am 25 years old male. I was so active with all the sports activity and all, for last one year. After I bought my bike I stopped playing most of the sports, also the walking came down to below average because of the bike. Does the less walking have something to do with all that I am suffering? I had two to three accidents with my bike, but none of them were serious ones. I mean I did not get hurt badly. Just some scratches on my hand. So I am confused if the condition is done from a trauma. The doctors asked me to take one month rest and physiotherapy at this moment.

"Hi doctor,I am a 27 year old male. I masturbate twice a week. Recently, during masturbation, I felt some pain on the back side of my neck and head. Please help.","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Masturbating two to three times a week is healthy unless you get addicted to the habit. This kind of pain or sprain happens due to increased blood flow to your penile region and vasoconstriction along with it. It resolves spontaneously once the excitation is over. This can be relieved by a little stretching after masturbation or by doing exercises for 30 minutes every day. There is nothing serious to worry about."

"Hi,I had unprotected intercourse with my partner a month back. I did not ejaculate inside her. Later to be sure, she did a home pregnancy test after 21 days, it came negative.

We are confused and worried if she is pregnant. She has PCOD also. She had her last periods 45 days back. Do we have to go for a blood test?","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. The best way to rule out pregnancy conclusively is serum beta HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) test if she has not had her menses yet. If the HCG levels are less than 3mIU/ml, then she is not pregnant for sure. The delay in menses is then likely to be due to PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease) itself.

"Hello doctor,I am 50 years old. My echo is normal with LVEF of 50% and dobutamine stress test negative for ischemia (LVEF of 58%). But, it shows a jerky septum? Is jerky septum a normal finding?","Hello. There are a few causes of jerky septum like bundle branch block, increased pressure in the right side of the heart, and disease in the pericardium. As your echo is normal, because of increased pressure on the right side of the heart, disease in pericardium is less likely. As you have not provided ECG (echocardiogram), I am unable to comment on bundle branch block. Still, a jerky septum in isolation is less likely to be pathological.

Is there any way I can fix this without going to the dentist? And yes, I do brush my teeth daily.","Hi. As per your history, you are having class 5 dental cavity in the lower tooth. You need to do filling (restoration) of the tooth as soon as possible. If you do not take measures at this time you may need RCT (root canal treatment) which will be 10 to 20 expensive and not as successful as filling. On your upper tooth, the line I understand is the gingival recession with abrasion, if you are right handed it must be on the left side or the side you keep your teeth brushing continuously. For this, you only need to use an ultrasoft toothbrush and check the video for modified Bass technique for tooth brushing. Also brush your teeth twice daily and keep the brush time of two to three minutes only.  For more information consult a dentist online"

"Hello doctor,I am a 32-year-old single male. In the past, I have experimented with using non-deglycyrrhizinated licorice to reduce my libido and make single life more manageable. I have hereditary low blood pressure so that the side effect was not an issue for me. However, after a few days of use, the licorice causes me to develop muscle aches all over my body. Which I assume are due to the reduced potassium levels from the licorice. Is there a better alternative to the licorice? Or a way to prevent the loss of potassium so I can use it for more than a few days at a time? No matter what I ate, (bananas, avocados, apricots), it did not seem to be enough.","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I can understand your concern. Non-deglycyrrhizinated licorice contains Glycyrrhizin which has some side-effects like hypertension, hypokalaemia, reduces testosterone, edema, etc., as you mentioned well. Muscle cramps and aches are most probably due to hypokalaemia. To fulfill the requirements of potassium you can take a banana, avocado, orange, lemon, apricots, etc. An alternative to non-deglycyrrhizinated licorice, you can take mint, flex seed, popcorn and soda.

"Hello doctor,You were wonderful in allaying some health anxiety over some skin issues several months ago. So, I thought I would consult with you on another question pertaining to my son. Unfortunately, a combination of my health anxiety and the big mistake of searching online has my mind imagining the worst with regard to my son. My son is 19 years old and has no diagnosed medical issues. I noticed back when he was about eight or ten years old that he had a mark resembling a cafe au lait mark on his back, in the upper shoulder area. I had always asked the pediatrician to look at it during his yearly physicals, and they made nothing of it. Throughout the years it has grown a bit and has become darker and more rough in texture. It is probably slightly less than an inch in length and looks like a few small lesions grouped together. Again, I have brought it to the pediatrician\\s attention and he was not concerned. Three months ago, I made an appointment for him and my other son with a dermatologist for a skin exam, and I pointed out the spots which I wanted to be checked in particular. We met with the physician\\s assistant there, and my younger son had a peculiar spot I pointed out, of which the PA conducted a shave biopsy, which came back as a mildly atypical junctional nevus. For my older son, I pointed out the spot on his back/shoulder, and the PA diagnosed it as a linear epidermal nevus. She said the chances of it becoming dangerous are slim to none. It may darken throughout the years, and they will simply monitor it at yearly visits. Unfortunately, I went on to research online about epidermal nevi and of course I ran into information showing a possible link to epidermal nevus syndrome and all of its associated neurological and skeletal defects. As I said, he is 19 and has no medical issues, is extremely intelligent, etc. In your opinion, is it safe to say that I should not be concerned about those syndromes? I presume it is primarily related to the numerous and systemic epidermal nevi, which he does not have, and I would think it would have presented by now? And my last even more neurotic question. My online research led me to some information saying that a certain type of epidermal nevus could be related to a gene mutation that could be passed along to an offspring, with them having possible serious skin scaling conditions, etc. Again, he has just one solitary small epidermal nevus. No biopsy was done, as the PA did not feel it was necessary. Do you feel there is any need for me to worry about that potential genetic mutation? Thank you so much for reading my long query.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. A solitary epidermal nevus is very common and does not pose any kind of serious health concern. Neither is a biopsy required. You are right. Any associated symptom should have been present since birth or early childhood in this case. Even if it is passed on to the future generations, it is harmless. A yearly medical examination is more than enough for the nevi in both your kids. Good luck."
"Hello doctor,Every night around 2-3 AM, any thought that crosses my mind makes me overthink about it. I am worried about such things that do not have a fixed solution. It may or may not happen. I\\ve tried listening to meditating sounds, calming sound during that time but to no avail. After an hour or two I do get normal but then I am so full of energy that I cannot fall asleep so I get up and start some work. (I am a freelancer working from home).I usually cannot sleep until my head feels heavy, eyes start closing and I start dozing off while working. For a few weeks, I have been sleeping in the afternoon or evening for three to five hours only. Rest of the time I am either thinking or working. Sometimes if I cannot stop thinking I smoke around two to three cigarettes to get over it. It does not help me sleep but helps me focus on work more and overthinking stops quite instantly.","Hello. Your blood report is absolutely normal (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and I do not think there is anything alarming. Yes, your lipid profile is deranged and if you are overweight then try to reduce weight. At your age, it is not common to see raised cholesterol. Regarding the issues you have during sleep, in my opinion, this is probably occurring due to anxiety. You should seek a psychiatrist consultation for treatment. Improve your sleep hygiene and this will improve the symptoms. Avoid giving attention to minor things. Take a high protein diet and complex carbs and low in fats. I hope this helps."
"Hi doctor,My sister is 23 years old. She had unhygienic sex a couple of weeks ago. She started feeling itchy on her vagina. I am worried it might be herpes but I need confirmation from a specialist before we visit the doctor. It looks clustered and yellow. No hard lump under and it just looks inflamed. She does not complain of pain anywhere else. There is no pain inside the urethra, no burning sensation while urinating and the discharge is whitish-yellowish and watery. She does not have any sign of fever. She bought labia herpes cream yesterday. After application it changed the color today to darker yellow and some of it fell off. What could this be?",Hi. I have reviewed the attached photographs (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The closely grouped fluid filled blisters and yellow crusted lesions seem to be most likely herpes infection. You do not have to apply Acyclovir cream as it will not be much effective in genital herpes. You should start with oral antiviral like tablet Acyclovir 400 mg thrice daily for a week and apply topical antibiotic like Mupirocin cream on the lesions twice daily. Do not use soap over the affected areas and wash only with plain water. Caused by herpes virus; either HSV1 or HSV2 (herpes simplex virus 1 or 2). Herpes genitalis. Avoid intercourse till the healing of lesions.  Take care.
"Hello doctor,I have been suffering from breathing issues for about two months. At that time, I was coming off Duloxetine HCl. I was also having weird headaches, but that has subsided. I have been to several doctors and had blood work, oxygen level test and pulmonary test. Everything came back normal. With my breathing, I have the constant urge to take a deep breath in hopes of getting that satisfying deep sigh. I am constantly thinking about my breathing, even when I sleep.

Now, I am willing to get a second opinion about this condition.","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. It is very good to know that you are doing well with medications and exercise. The development of collateral blood supply in the lower limbs is a good option. You could discuss this with your doctor and postpone angiogram and stenting. However, it is important to realize that collateral vessels are small and do not provide the same amount of blood, as the normal vessels do. Besides, peripheral angiography and stenting are safe procedures. So, I would advise angiography to see the state of the blood vessels and collaterals and then, you can decide for stenting.

"Hi doctor,I am a 33 year old female. I have never smoked. I am not overweight and I do not have diabetes. I have been having some left leg issues. It started six months back. I started limping because my left calf, ankle and groin were hurting. My emergency Doppler venous ultrasound was clear. I had a D-dimer and that was negative. I had an MRI of my left ankle that showed a talofibular ligament sprain on my left ankle. I also had an arterial Doppler ultrasound that showed decreased flow of left anterior tibial artery and increased peak systolic velocity in the left common femoral artery. But, there was no stenosis, no sclerosis and no plaque. Could the sprain have caused that decreased flow? After three months, it became normal again. Then, while having pedicure the woman massaged my ankle and leg. Since then the pain has returned to my left ankle and left leg. I had another D-dimer done three weeks ago that was negative. I have also recently started experiencing cold left foot and a left cold lower leg at night. By morning, both the legs as well as the feet are of the same temperature. I do get pain in the buttocks and the pain is going down my leg like a sciatic pain on the left leg. Do I have peripheral artery disease? Could a blood clot be causing it? I have a four hours flight next week and I am worried about flying. Is it safe to fly? Would the arterial Doppler and D-dimer be able to tell if I have a blood clot in my artery? Or is a D-dimer just for the veins? My LDL was 10 points above normal in my last blood test. But, my doctor did not seem to be concerned as my HDL was high. I have attached the reports for your reference. Please help me.","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. From your description, I understand that the first time you had a problem with your left leg was due to a sprain (talofibular ligament) around the ankle and it got resolved. I suspect the same problem or something similar is causing you the pain again. It is highly unlikely for a 33 year old lady and a non-smoker to have a peripheral vascular disease. The arterial Doppler did show a decreased blood flow, but it might be due to a temporary spasm of the vessel than any specific pathology or disease. Moreover, no clot was found nor was there any change suggesting peripheral vascular disease. It is absolutely safe to fly and you need not worry about it. An arterial Doppler will be able to make out if you have a clot. D-dimer test is only for the veins and is not useful in arterial disease. I suggest you to look for causes either in your footwear or any strain which you have put repeatedly on your ankle causing repeated sprain in the left ankle. You can get an orthopedic consultation to be sure of the same. If he or she does not find any problem and your pain persists even after appropriate treatment then further evaluation can be done by a vascular surgeon. But, I do feel you may not require it."

I have reviewed your query. There are specific indications for dialysis in patients with chronic kidney disease. They include low creatinine clearance, high potassium, patient becoming acidotic, symptoms of uremia (increased urea in the blood), loss of appetite, uremic heart problems and accumulation of fluid in body parts like feet causing edema and lungs causing shortness of breath. Even if your mother is not experiencing any of the above symptoms, depending on her history of chronic diabetes and levels of creatinine clearance, (I could not calculate exact creatinine clearance for your mother as you have not mentioned her weight, but taking an average female weight of 60 kilograms, your mother\\s creatinine clearance is very low), she might be considered for dialysis, which can be confirmed by a few other tests and examination done by your physician.

"Hello doctor,My baby is 2 months old. He is on pumped milk and once a day formula milk (Enfamil). He is gassy and cries mostly from evening till midnight. Spits up even after burping for 30 minutes. I give exercise, and tummy time, but there is no change. He gets reflux which makes him uncomfortable.His spits are watery. My pediatrician suggested Colicaid and Yamoo which I am using four times a day. Still, he gets gas and spits up. And now he did not poop for the past two days and trying very hard and cries in between feeds by trying to poop. Is this an effect of enzymes? Please help.","Hello. Please note the following, 1. The clinical picture that you are giving is most suggestive of reflux. It is advisable first to get a reflux study done to find the grade of reflux. 2. The initial medications to be given in reflux are Zantac (Ranitidine) and Perinorm (Metoclopramide). In most cases, this works. The next step beyond this is Gaviscon (antacid) and feed thickening. 3. Also very important is to keep the child in a slightly upright position (30 degrees to ground) after feeding (and most of the time) to reduce the amount of discomfort the child may be facing due to reflux. This one method goes a long way in helping chil ChatDoctor.  As the child grows bigger, the need for this reduces eventually. 4. As regards to the crying episodes during stools, if the stools are hard or if there is gas the child may cry. Both are less likely due to the enzymes. They are mostly physiological considering the clinical scenario of the child.  Take care."
"Hello doctor,I am a 62-year-old male. I went for a routine X-ray, and the radiologist found some streakiness in the lower left lung. He said it appeared small and not significant, but it was adviced that I should come back in six months for a comparative X-ray and that it could just be a scar from an earlier infection.I have read that a small scar area is probably non-progressive but I have also read about IPF, and that fills me with fear. Spirometry test was normal as it was a physical exam. I am so scared that it might be a progressive disease, but I hope that it is just an old scar as it is really small. Otherwise mostly healthy with no cough or difficulty breathing at all. Are all lung scars progressive?","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Does not look worrisome (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Small streaks or fibrosis is usually due to old infection or collapses etc., The usual cause for such fibrosis is typically an infection and commonly found at such age groups. The probability of IPF (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) is extremely low as the fibrosis is not diffuse or bilateral, no symptoms and spirometry are normal. So, I think it is not worrisome at present and should follow up as advised to be sure. Should consult your doctor earlier if developed any symptoms. Majority of the scar is non-progressive and extremely common to find such scars on routine X-ray and the majority are benign. I hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts."

I have just gone through your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I do not think you have to worry much.

Even when washing her hair, lots of hair loss is seen. I am worried about it. What could be the reason? Any remedies?","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Perhaps her hair fall is due to telogen effluvium. Telogen is the shedding phase of hair cycle. Usually, after an illness like high-grade fever, typhoid, malaria jaundice, etc., hair gets shifted from growing phase (anagen) to shedding phase (telogen) which is manifested as precipitous hair fall.

"Hello doctor, I was recently diagnosed with asthma, bronchitis, and pharyngitis. I am currently on some temporary medicines, and antibiotics to treat these sicknesses along with an inhaler. I do not feel that bad, but I need to take the pills. However, being in college, I have a big game this weekend. This question may seem to be a little stupid but, would mixing of alcohol with antibiotics be deadly? Or would it just slow down the process of making me better? I know it is a silly question to ask, but I am half minded on it and would prefer not to end up in the hospital.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I guess you are taking medicines for bronchitis and pharyngitis. So most probably it is an antibiotic medicine. Generally, we advise to take medicines after food with water, and within limits taking some medicines with low alcohol does not cause any harm. However, it is best to avoid to do so. The idea of taking medicines with alcohol is not advised as it can be harmful. Alcohol and some medicines cause gastritis, and you may vomit out. Also, it can cause liver toxicity with such combination. So there is no logic of taking medicines with alcohol. Also, alcohol intensifies the effects of certain medicines, and alcohol can not dissolve some medicines. Serious interactions also can occur.So it is a better idea to consult your doctor before doing so."
"Hello doctor,About 6 years ago, I engaged in some urethral play with my partner. I put a small pen into the urethra, only about 2 to 3 inches in. Since then, I feel I may have done damage to the smooth muscles in the corpus spongiosum or the tunica albuginea. I can feel, right inbetween the corpus spongiosum and corpus cavernosa what feels like an enlarged muscle and seem to run the entire length of the urethra, maybe compression damage done to something there. As a result, I have slight difficulty urinating and very very bad premature ejaculation which did not ever happen. I also have nocturnal emissions frequently on a full bladder. I know I may need to have an MRI, but if the muscles are damaged here, what are the surgical options? Can anything be done? I also tried Priligy and it made no difference (10 to 20 seconds).","Hi. First of all, let me assure you, premature ejaculation is due to excessive sensitivity of the sympathetic nervous system and not due to any trauma. If the urethra is damaged because of foreign body insertion, then the only problem will be urethral stricture, which will cause difficulty in urination. Also, nocturnal emissions are natural, although frequency might vary. If you still have doubts, you can proceed with ultrasound Doppler study of penis and cystoscopy. That would reveal whether you have suffered any injury in the past.  Take care."

"Hello doctor, I am 24 years old. I had my kidney stone removed a year ago for causing mild hydronephrosis at my right kidney. During the treatment, I was exposed to full of radiation, abdominal CT scan, lithotripsy, fluoroscopy, and another fluoroscopy during stent insertion. I am not sure how the doctor manages the radiation. I did my treatment abroad and it is not really a well-developed country. He might not even care bout it. I studied some about radiation when I was in dental school so I am very scared of the side effects.So if I am to have another case of hydronephrosis, should I just remove the kidney rather than undergoing such radiation which may cause me high risk of future cancer? Because as you can see, I am still so young and I just started my career. What do you suggest? Do the pros outweigh the cons or vice versa? Is there another less risky treatment in terms of radiation? How about invasive treatment? Is the risk higher aside from the slow healing? And I am serious about the removal if indeed it has lower radiation risk, even though I know kidney is very important. Please suggest.",Hello. There are enough studies and literature which prove that though there is radiation exposure during CT (computed tomography) scan in the removal of kidney stone it is in low dose and chances of cancer do not increase. So do not worry about that. I do not think removing kidney to escape from radiation exposure is a good option. You should not think of that. If there is again stone formation then there is a treatment called ultrasound-guided lithotripsy (ESWL) which can break your stone from outside without any radiation exposure. So you can do ESWL (extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy) if required later but no need to remove the kidney.  Take care.

Ventricular fibrillation, the commonest cause is coronary artery disease. The other causes are dilated cardiomyopathy or low heart function. What is his ejection fraction? Low ejection fraction due to any reason like coronary artery disease or others can lead to ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation.

In treatment, he should receive Cordarone (Amiodarone), and multiple other medicines depending upon the echocardiogram and angiography reports.

What you are describing is most probably breaks in the gel shaped part of the eye and is called floaters. It is a normal and physiological condition that we see in patients that have refractive errors and have no significant consequences. If these symptoms persist and are causing you discomfort look for an ophthalmologist that does a procedure called laser vitreolysis who could break them down into smaller bits so that you do not notice them that much and that is pretty much the only method of treatment.
"Hello doctor,Yesterday, my wife had bleeding for a minute after we had sex for the first time. What would be the reason for this problem?","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I presume that your wife had bleeding through her vagina.If it is the first time that you both had sex, then you need not have to worry at all. This is due to the rupture of a thin membrane which covers the vaginal orifice (opening). This membrane is called the hymen membrane. This membrane is vascular enough to cause bleeding. But it remits on its own."

"Hello doctor,I am a 30-year-old man. Recently, I was tested for complete STD checkup with TORCH test. I have a few doubts",Hello. Fourth generation p24 anti-HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) antibody is conclusive after a window of two to three weeks. So a negative result at 28 days is reliable.  A positive IgG (immunoglobulin G) for HSV (herpes simplex virus) 1 and 2 means you have an old infection with herpes 1 or 2. HSV type 2 commonly causes genital herpes and HSV type 1 causes orolabial herpes. There is a risk that you may pass on the infection to your sexual partner. CMV (Cytomegalovirus) positivity is quite common in general population. It is a common viral infection and does not cause any issues in immune competent healthy individuals.

"Hello doctor,Right ovary contains 3.6x2.1x3.1cm cyst, thick septation and few punctate echogenic lesions within lumen. Previously cyst measured 3.8x2.4cm abutting ovary. Adjacent ovarian parenchyma contains 6 mm and 15 mm follicles. Small amount of fluid was seen in para-adnexal area and posterior CDS.My questions are","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I will try to give you answers to the best of my knoweldge. Small amount of fluid is expected near posterior cul de sac and para adnexal area during ovulation time. Although it can be seen during pelvic inflammatory disease. Multiple follicle grow every month in both the ovaries which later on is dominated by a single follicle which continues to grow to a certain size, and later ruptures releasing the egg. So your 6 mm and 15 mm follicles are normal to be there. Without doing a histopathological examination, it is difficult to tell about the origin of the thick septation but as most of the ovarian cysts are epitheleal in origin, so 90 % chances are they are made of some kind of epitheleal tissue. Any kind of debris inside the cyst will give rise to echogenicity in USG. It could be blood, it could be tissues of different origin. There are different types of ovarian cyst, to rule out malignancy you need to do certain tumor markers like CA 125, etc., and MRI or CT scan. Since it is receding in size, my best guess that your cyst is some kind of retention cyst of ovary. There is a large possibility that the cyst will regress soon. I think your cyst is an incidental finding as you have stated there is minimal symptom. Your gynecologist will be the best person to advise you in this matter. So discuss with her about the various possibilities and methods of treatment."

I only took medicines for a month that time. THree and a half months back, I started taking Cordarone 200 mg. And Xarelto 15 mg. Until now, AF never came back. I already stopped Xarelto one month ago. Can I reduce Cordarone into half or take it every two days? Two weeks ago, suddenly my entire body felt itchy and swollen for two hours, then went away by itself. Please advice.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I have reviewed your health query and can well understand you are worried about your heart health. I would not say to stop Xarelto (Rivaroxaban) and/or Cordarone (Amiodarone) as these are very important medications and you need them. For stent patients, Xarelto reduces the risk of strokes, pulmonary embolism, and deep venous thrombosis, and clots initiating from the stents area. It is a blood thinning agent and keeps the blood running in veins and arteries without excessive clotting. Cordarone, on the other hand, keeps you away from heart rhythm problems like AF (atrial fibrillation). With the fact that you are having no arrhythmias while taking this medication, I do not think there is an obvious need to change the dosage. If your cardiologist gets some indication to reduce the dosage after examining you physically, that would be a different story. My final suggestion is to consult your treating physician before changing medications. Hope this helps. For more infiormation consult a cardiologist online"

"Hello doctor,My 1-year-old child has been diagnosed with tetralogy of Fallot. She has been experiencing fast breathing, difficulty in feeding, failure to thrive, clubbed fingers but the cardiologist told me they will not be in a rush to fix the problem.

"Hello doctor,I have mild scoliosis convex to the left and was wondering if a left knee arthroscopy can be the cause of my posture and/or pain issues. For example, sitting, standing. Also, having scoliosis, would that cause a blood clot (pulmonary embolism) after this surgery? With being a severe asthmatic.",Hello. Scoliosis is a structural problem and knee pain will not cause this. Arthroscopy can rarely lead to a clot formation but is not necessarily a known risk factor for DVT (deep vein thrombosis) as you are likely to mobilize very quickly and the procedure is usually short. Scoliosis does not add to the risks either. For more information consult an orthopaedician and traumatologist online

"Hello doctor,I am suspicious of lymphoma. In the summer, I had an itchy rash on my neck, it went away, came back, and now went again. I have bilateral hip and bone pain. I have night sweats two to three times weekly. I had a low-grade fever right before my period and will go away. No palpable or noticeable lymph nodes except in thigh about an inch away from the groin. I have had CBC's and sed rates completed at least five times in two months. I took a chest x-ray, head and abdomen CT scan, and pelvic ultrasound. I consulted an ENT who looked down the throat with a scope, and everything is negative, so doctors will not pursue lymphoma any further. Do you think with everything so far, should I still be investigating lymphoma?I am currently on Lisinopril 20 mg.","Hello, Welcome to the ChatDoctor. In lymphoma, there is a presence of multiple enlarged lymph nodes. If you have lymphoma, then enlarged node could have been detected in CT (computed tomography) scan. If you do not have multiple enlarged nodes then lymphoma is less likely. The fever and itchy rash are not classical signs of lymphoma. For itchy rash, Levocetirizine can be prescribed.

"Hi doctor,My 9 months old baby had a high fever, cough, and cold. Initially, it was the fever that was concerning. Later the cough was severe and hospitalized for bronchiolitis. He was put on a nebulizer and after three days his condition has improved. So, the doctor suggested moving from the nebulizer to Asthalin huf puf. Later that night, he had a continuous cough for one hour and was then back on nebulizer. He is put on oxygen support as his SpO2 dropped to around 86. We are much worried as he is premature and was formula fed mostly. Please let us know if this behavior is normal with bronchiolitis.","Hi. The symptoms that your child has been suggestive of bronchiolitis. In bronchiolitis, nebulization needs to be given for five to seven days; usually, the child recovers in seven days. Your child was discharged from the hospital and developed respiratory distress after continuous cough and spO2 has decreased. I think that during continuous cough your child has aspirated the food and this has now led to bronchopneumonia. In my opinion, your child needs antibiotics and nebulization with a repeat chest x-ray to see the extent of pneumonia. I think your child needs admission for a week after which he will be alright. Take care of your child."
"Hi doctor,I was on a business trip and my friend and I went to a high-end brothel. My friend hired two girls and brought them back to the hotel. He had to take a phone call and while the girls were waiting for him they performed oral sex on me for a few minutes without a condom. They had no symptoms in their lips and facial region. I am worried, I contracted herpes. I got tested for chlamydia, syphilis, gonorrhea, hepatitis, and HIV and they came up negative. It has been four weeks since the incindent and I have no herpes symtomps. What are my chances of having herpes? I know people might not show symptoms. I am married and I felt very guilty for what I had done and told my wife. We are planing to have kids. What are the chances of her getting herpes and passing on to our baby? I appreciate all your help with my concerns.","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  I can understand your concern. There are very fewer chances of you having herpes since four weeks have passed and you have not developed any symptoms. But yes, herpes can even occur as sub clinical infection without presenting with any signs and symptoms. I would recommend you go for an ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test for herpesvirus that is HSV 1 IgG and HSV 2 IgG and HSV 1 IgM and HSV 2 IgM. These tests are confirmatory in herpesvirus infection. These will tell your herpes status. If positive there are chances of passing the infection to your wife but not very high since you are asymptomatic. I would recommend you to first get the tests done and find your status. Then we can discuss further possibilities. I hope this helps."
"Hello doctor,How accurate are skin prick tests for predicting positive reactions? My family is interested in a pet and I have had negative skin prick and blood work tests for dander. Before we bring a pet in and before my kids become bonded, is it reasonable to assume negative tests will translate in no reactions. Occasionally, when I interact with animals, I have a reaction but it is difficult to determine whether it is actually the pollen which I am highly allergic to.","Hi. Skin prick allergy testing is one of the most accurate ways of diagnosing the allergen, one is sensitive to. It is definitely more accurate than blood immunoCAP testing (blood allergy testing). Skin prick testing checks your sensitivity to the protein in question. Even if sensitive, it need not mean you are allergic. Whereby, a positive result need not always mean you will get allergy with the protein. It means that your immune system is sensitised to that allergen and that an allergy can occur in subsequent exposures to the allergen. A negative in skin prick testing will mean that you are not sensitive to that protein and that you will not end with an allergy upon its exposure. This is true. But it is specific for the particular type of allergen. What all animal danders were included in your profile and what was the response to each? Is there a photograph or record of the wheal or flare that developed after each prick? Was the test read by a clinical allergist or immunologist and were you provided a report as to that you are not allergic to any animal dander? Were you diagnosed with pollen allergy or sensitivity? Have you observed any symptoms of allergy while in gardens or bushy areas? Or in any particular season? Does any one else in your family have allergies?"
"Hello doctor,I had the Skyla IUD inserted two months ago to lighten my very heavy menstrual flows hopefully. My first period after insertion was very heavy and painful, more than usual, but I heard that was likely to happen. It lasted for two and a half weeks. Since then, I have had spotting daily, some days heavier than others, but very frequent. I also have been experiencing mild cramping and bleeding after intercourse. Is this a dangerous condition?","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Irregular bleeding is the most common side effects of hormonal IUD (intrauterine device). You should expect irregular bleeding or vaginal spotting for six to eight weeks after the insertion. I recommend you to reach inside your vagina and feel the string. If you can feel the string the chance that IUD is in the right place is very high so you should not worry too much. Taking Motrin (Ibuprofen) and applying heating pads should help with cramping. The string should be checked by yourself now and then to make sure it is still in the right place."

I was wondering if you could help me understand the process more. Thank you.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. The frenectomy procedure as such does not close the gap. It involves the removal of fibrous tissue that is present. Then, closure of the gap can be achieved. The minimal movement to close the gap is with the help of removable appliances like retainers. More movement to close the gap, if required, can only be achieved with braces. Clinical pictures and radiographic evidence will be necessary to predict the treatment plan and the outcome.

"Hi doctor,I had high blood pressure, low heart rate. Is my ECG showing infarction? I have no chest pain. At the time of ECG, my blood pressure was 168/100 and heart beat 46.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I have gone through your ECG (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The reports mentioned on ECG are machine generated and are frequently inaccurate. There is no clear-cut evidence of myocardial infarction on ECG. As you also do not have any history of chest pain, it is unlikely for you to have any heart attack. And yes, heart rate is low and it is sinus bradycardia. Do you have any symptoms of dizziness, syncope, etc? If not then it needs no action at the moment. However, you should undergo thyroid test to rule out hypothyroidism as a cause for low heart rate. Also, should undergo echo, which will additionally provide the assurance to rule out MI. Also, if echo is normal then should have TMT (treadmill test), which will help in ruling out minor blockages, subclinical ischemic heart disease and to look for maximum heart rate you achieve during exercise, which will help in determining the benign nature of sinus bradycardia if the adequate heart rate is achieved. Also, high bp can also cause low heart rate by a reflex mechanism. So you should have medicine for it. I guess you are not receiving any medicines like beta blockers which can reduce heart rate. You should have tablet Telma CTD (Telmisartan and Chlorthalidone) 40/12.5 mg once a day in the morning for hypertension so get it prescribed by a local doctor.

It is known that some people experience increased anxiety when taking Adderall ( Dextroamphetamine, Amphetamine). If the excessive stress continues to be problematic and has not settled in few weeks, discuss with your psychiatrist about possibly reducing the dose of Adderall or looking at alternative medication for managing ADHD (attention-deficit hyperactive disorder).

"Hello doctor,How accurate in your opinion is the Lelli ACL (Lever test)? I am almost three months post-op of having my ACL reconstructed along with a few lesions addressed during the surgery.

It has been three days since the incident and the knee now feels a lot looser and I have some pain in different areas.

I will have to see my surgeon and physio soon but I am just wondering how accurate the Lelli test is. There seems to be no difference when comparing the test in both knees.","Hello. I read through the concern. The Lelli test is accurate in diagnosing acute on chronic ACL tears, more sensitive than many other traditional tests performed in an acute condition, especially partial and acute tears. Do not be afraid. Keep calm. Take precautions not to strain and exert your knee. Keep it supported with an ACL brace until you get properly diagnosed by a good orthopedic or physio. Do not jump to a conclusion and keep worrying as you might not be accurate enough to say the reason for translation as there could be many factors like muscle inhibitions and imbalances that exist post surgery which may all confuse you leading to false positive tests.

I got to understand that the primary complaint of your mother is nasal obstruction. How long is it present? If it is antrochoanal polyp, as CT suggests (attachment removed to protect patient identity), it needs surgery. AC polyp does not reduce with medicines. More important reason to get surgery is that in above 40 years age with nasal polyp is a risk. Biopsy has to be taken to rule out malignancy when it is only on one side.

Considering the fact that your periods have been irregular since long and the interval is three to four months, then for sure, you should be evaluated for causes of oligomenorrhea like PCOD (polycystic ovary disease), hypothyroidism, and hyperprolactinemia.

Once ruled out then a per speculum examination can be conducted to rule out cervicitis, or erosions which can cause post-coital bleeding. So a gynecologist examination would be recommended."
"Hello doctor,My right inner cheek is swollen. This happened for the second time this month. The swollen cheek falls between the teeth while talking or eating. I am having pain too.","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I have read through your complaint and the relevant details. The swelling should be the reason for any tooth infection associated with the right lower back tooth region in the least case. If that is ruled out during a dental consultation, then it could be the infection in the salivary gland. I say this because you have mentioned a history of swelling interferes with eating and talking. Usually, salivary gland swellings affect both the sides of the cheek region and also below the tongue with or without pain. You also got to check if you have  ChatDoctor."
"Hello doctor,My baby is one year old. She has soft teeth in the front and she is not able to bite anything with the upper teeth. If she bites, the teeth start chipping. What am I to do?","Hi. If the enamel matrix formation is deficient, it will result in soft teeth that chips and/or decays easily. It may also result in an atypical or abnormal tooth shape. This is called enamel hypoplasia. Treatment for this dental condition includes removal of the very soft enamel and placement of a white tooth-colored filling in that area. Occasionally, the aberration or deviation from normal growth in the enamel is extensive enough that we recommend a white stainless steel cap as a temporary crown during the growing years. Maintain proper oral hygiene of the child by wiping the teeth with a soft cloth or a very soft brush."

"Hello doctor,I had suffered from common cold symptoms three months back. It resolved completely in about 18 to 19 days. Started with constant sneezing followed by a runny nose, then nose cleared and sneezing stopped but felt an uneasiness in palate and throat turned sore, getting worse with time and then persistent coughing. I consulted my general practitioner on the fourth or fifth day who prescribed some medications. I started feeling better after the seventh day and the throat improved. But almost the next day onwards I started feeling worse again but this time it was not sore throat or a runny nose exactly, just felt the mucous inside throat all the time. Never felt feverish as such or found raised body temperature (by touching only) and experienced mild body ache here and there. Nevertheless, around 1 month after this resolved totally as said above, since yesterday I have started feeling same common cold symptoms, runny nose (not sneezing or coughing much though) with uneasiness in the palate, no raised body temperature but little feverish with mild body ache here and there.In both the aforesaid cases I had taken a Cetirizine tablet on the same day (but little later in the day) the symptoms started.

"Hi doctor,I am a male. I had unprotected vaginal sex single exposure with a girl. Nine months later, I found she is HIV positive. My question","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. For this question, it is based on the test you do. HIV enters the body on day-0, and goes to the nearest lymph node and starts replication by day-7. This is when, p24 antigens (core proteins of HIV virus) get detected and in turn, the body starts defense and produces HIV antibodies, and these get tested positive in 15 to 23 days. But, due to neutralization of antigens by antibodies, as per theory, testing after 23 days up to 28 days may give false negatives (<0.001%). So, getting a fourth generation HIV test after 28 days is confirmation by 99 %. Yes, not only in medical, but in any field, 100 % is not possible. And taking medico legality, no one gives you 100 % cure. No further test is needed. You are negative by 99.99 %. A change in result is unlikely. You will stay negative forever. The window period is a period where lab tests cannot detect the presence of infection by tests. For more information consult an HIV AIDS specialist online"

Rickets can be due to vitamin D deficiency or hypophosphatemia. You did not tell me the phosphate level in blood of your child.

How do you recommend using coconut oil in one\\s routine to reap benefits and avoid breakouts? If someone wants to use natural coconut oil on their face, what kind do you recommend using (i.e. unrefined, organic, etc.)?","Hi. Coconut oil is extracting traditionally from raw coconut or from  ChatDoctor.  It is saturated oil and frequently used in skin, hairs or cooking purposes. This oil has health-promoting properties. It contains several fatty acids that have benefits to skin health as well. Now we will discuss some more about coconut oil step by step.

"Hello doctor,I noticed a small triangular bald spot in my beard three weeks ago. It was likely alopecia areata. Saw my dermatologist last week, she said it was likely folliculitis. I have had folliculitis before in the same area and it was much different. She is the doctor. So I accepted and moved on. One small spot that has some hair growing back, small thin white hair. Yesterday, I noticed what appeared to be a bald spot in my pubic hair above the penis. When I trimmed the hair back, it revealed a quarter sized bald spot and a smaller dime sized spot. I am not sure how long they may have been there as they were somewhat masked by a longer pubic hair. So, now I have what I believe to be three spots, two below abdomen and one on beard. My concern is more of them spreading than the current spots.I am now thinking back about the annual checkup that I had with my GP six months back. I advised him that in the past year the amount of semen I produce has gone down drastically. I thought it may be a testosterone issue. He advised it was likely a result of my vasectomy the year before. Also as a part of my visit, my WBC was lower than normal, outside of the range by a couple. He was not concerned about that either.My question is whether any of these things are related","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Alopecia areata is an immune disorder and is separated from folliculitis and it has nothing to do with your semen count and low WBC. Nevertheless, please send me a few good quality photographs taken in a natural light."

Passage of white or brown particles in stool does not harm baby and there is no need to be alarmed.

Can you please tell me any tablet that I can use in the meantime.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Sorry for the pain you are bearing because of the prevailing situation. As you have already mentioned there is a cavity and when it reaches up to the pulp there develops an irreversible stage which generally is more painful during night time as we sleep. I think your tooth has reached the stage of irreversible pulpitis and a root canal treatment is now must in order to save the remaining tooth. So go for it as soon as the situation in your area gets better. For now, take Amoxicillin clavulanate 500 mg (thrice daily) for five days, Paracetamol 500 mg to thrice daily SOS. Do not take Paracetamol when there is no pain but do complete the Amoxicillin course. Additionally, you can take any one for gastritis if you have a tendency to develop gastritis with antibiotics. You can take PAN-D (Pantoprazole) or Omez (Omeprazole). Take them on empty stomach. Do salt water rinse regularly. You can apply clove oil at the site, it is a good anti-inflammatory. Maintain good oral hygiene regularly, but for sure get it treated. Avoid eating from the affected side until it gets treated or even if you eat make sure nothing gets lodged in that tooth. Do mouth rinses with plain water regularly so that there is no food stuck.  ChatDoctor.  I hope this helps."

Unwanted 72 is an emergency contraceptive pill containing high amount of progesterone. These medicines have a severe side effect of heavy or irregular bleeding. Your wife had the same side effect. Please check her hemoglobin levels; she might turn anemic if she bleeds much. Continue taking iron pills. It might take one or two cycles to get her periods to get regular again.

"Hello doctor,I am 18 years old female and sexually not active. A month back, I woke up and peed straight up blood. I went to the ER and was diagnosed a bladder infection/UTI. I was prescribed Bactrim and the next day woke up with a rash. It turns out I was allergic. So, the next day I started a new medicine and took it for a few days. The blood stopped, but I felt pain, so I went back to the ER. They told me my UTI was gone and to stop taking the medicine. A few days later, I saw blood when I wiped after peeing, but it looks like it was in my discharge. It went on a few times, and I went back to the ER three days ago and said that I was peeing blood again. So, I am worried. I have not gotten my period this month, and no, I am not pregnant.

You should maintain your oral health. As I have seen in pictures, there is stain deposition in your back teeth (attachment removed to protect patient identity).

Brush twice daily (especially night brushing), flossing, avoid smoking and gutkha paan. Make your teeth free from any deposition. Change brush every two months. If you follow these instructions, you do not need any scaling for several years. The most important thing is proper brushing technique.

What should I do to terminate it, if I am pregnant? Kindly help me out.","Hello. I have reviewed your query thoroughly. I-pill or emergency contraceptive pills have very minimal chance of failure if taken immediately after intercourse within 24 hours and chances of failure gradually increase after that even if taken within 72 hours. There is about one to two percent chance of failure of an emergency pill or i-pill in your case. But we can be quite sure of its success if with ChatDoctor.  Based on the dates given by you, today must be 8 days following the date of the intercourse. In that case, to find out if you are pregnant, you can get a serum beta hCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin) testing done. For the urine pregnancy tests to show the result if pregnant, it must be at least 10 to 14 days following intercourse. If you want to know urgently whether you are pregnant, you can get serum beta hCG testing. If you can wait another week, you can get a urine pregnancy testing, which if positive must be followed up by ultrasound imaging. Only after then and after consulting an obstetrician, should the abortion be planned under guidance. Furthermore, if you are sexually active regularly, it is better to choose other regular contraceptive methods after consulting an obstetrician and gynecologist instead of i-pill. I-pills are meant to be taken only in case of unexpected accidental unprotected sex, but not on a regular basis."

This could be ovulation bleeding. Usually it may take about 6 months to conceive after stopping the birth control pills. But your cycle has become irregular after stopping the pills and it is difficult to predict the ovulation time now. If spotting does not stop or if you experience pain, then you should get an internal scan done to see the cause of spotting.

"Hi doctor,I am a 53 year old female. My periods have been delayed for two weeks. Till now they are normally regular. Could it be the early onset of menopause or they will eventually come?","Hello. If you have been regular with your menses these years and this is the first episode at 53 years of age when the menses have been delayed by two weeks, the causes can be a possible initiation of perimenopausal stage where menses are often delayed for a month or two and slowly tend to stop in next one to two years. Perimenopausal stage can be verified with the hormonal FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) and LH (Luteinizing hormone) levels which if high shall indicate an onset of perimenopausal stage. However, it is suggested that pregnancy should anyways be ruled out and if negative then you can wait naturally for your menses to resume. Hence, try maintaining a menstrual calendar and keep a mark for your dates, duration of flow and quantity to evaluate the possible onset of a perimenopausal state."
"Hello doctor,I am a 31-year-old female. I think I have pinworms. My butt (perineal and anus area) kept vibrating like a cellphone, about once every two seconds, all day. I started taking probiotics and now it is not as constant, but happens many times a day still. I researched it, and some people say it could be worms. I took Reese\\s Pinworm medicine and there were a few small half to one-inch white worms. My anus itches every now and then. Two days in a row it was very itchy. But it is not extra itchy at night, which is supposed to be the main symptom. I do feel them especially at night and it disgusts me.Do you think the cellphone-like vibrating is because of the worms? I am very disgusted, upset, and terrified. I think I got it from eating kale and spinach that I did not wash. I do work in a school, too. I heard apple cider vinegar is supposed to create an uninviting atmosphere for them. Does that mean if I drink it they will start coming out of me in various places, and alive or will I just poop them out?And garlic and carrots, would I just poop them out dead after eating these? I want to take lots of things to be rid of them, but do not want to see anything come out except my anus, and must be dead. I took the medicine only for four days. Will they take a while to go away?","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I understand your concern. I will advise not to use the apple cider vinegar, but garlic and carrots can be taken, and they will help in further elimination of the pinworms. It will come out only through your anus, and not through anywhere else. You have taken the pinworm solution, so that complete elimination may take around a week. Since there was almost immediate evacuation the next day, it is a good sign and it will keep coming out. I will also advise you to take Mebendazole 150 mg separately, and that will also help in the treatment. It can be taken as a single dose at bedtime. This excessive itching could be due to the concentration of the organisms in the tract and it will slowly get better. You have already taken medicine and a course of Mebendazole will further help in the treatment."

"Hi doctor,I have been taking 4 mg of Xanax a day to treat severe panic attack syndrome and associated high levels of general anxiety for 15 years. My doctor arrived at the 4 mg per day amount gradually and it works very well along with CBT from a therapist. Before two months, when I received the medication from the pharmacy it was for 3 mg /day. I asked them to double check and that was the quantity that my doctor had written. I call his office and the office manager said that she would ask him about it. When I called the next day she said that he did not make a mistake and I asked for an explanation and was told that he did not give one.I started to feel sick a few days later and panic attacks actually started to increase the day that I talk to his office manager. I suffered minor but disruptive withdrawal symptoms physically and mentally for about two weeks and then they subsided but panic attacks continued to occur at random every day and my GAD symptoms increased to the point where CBT methods were not working.Then last month, the script was back to 4 mg per day normal dosage. I thought yes, back to normal. But again this month the script was back down to 3 mg per day which means I am going to experience a minor hell again.I am a defense and aerospace engineer who works on a contract basis through an agency and the client had noticed a drop in my performance before month but back to normal last month, now they are going to see it again and I will probably lose the contract job. I also started online system engineer classes and I am freaking out over being able to handle the exams and homework as I typically work on the class at night and am now without my evening dose. I again asked for an explanation and was not given any.My question is a 25% cut in dosage physically dangerous and I am well aware of the strong psychological addition issues, so will this settle down before my career and social life and general well being take a hit and I revert to hiding in my apartment with my dog and my employer and friends will give up on me.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum.

"Hello doctor,I am 40 years old male, obese, non-smoking, non-alcoholic, non-diabetic. My lipids and blood pressure are controlled with Rosuvastatin 5 mg and Olmesartan 20 mg. My query is that I walk regularly brisk and my pulse goes up to 145 and 150 without any breathlessness and recovery is also good as it drops around 25 points within one minute. Does this mean my heart does not have plaque and I am safe? After 150 pulse, slight discomfort or maybe anxiety but no breathlessness. I am very scared to do TMT test but also anxious to know that if I am able to touch 150 pulse without any issue that means my heart is in perfect condition?","Hello. Yes, if your heart rate is going above 150 without any chest pain or heaviness then the probability of significant blockages (more than 60 to 70 percent) is very low. However, this or even TMT will not help to rule out plaquing. TMT does not help in the diagnosis or ruling out plaquing as blood supply to the heart is not decreased even at very high heart rate. For plaques, CT coronary angiography is a good investigation. Although not absolutely necessary in you, you may undergo screening CT angiography or TMT in a few years just be on safer side considering the risk factors.

"Hello doctor,I would like to know an orthopedist opinion about my mother\\s situation. She had femur plasmacytoma 20 years ago and 4 prostheses, because she had many infections after the operations. She remained with her external popliteus paralyzed. Now, she began to feel his knee mobile, and she could not walk because of it. There are some noises too. A few doctors said she needs Megasystem-C Link prosthesis, which would totally replace her hip and knee. What is your advice? Is there any intermediate option, like replacing only the actual prosthesis and adding pieces of bone? We heard that, in case of choosing the Megasystem-C, that can lead to amputation.

"Hello doctor,My mom is a glaucoma patient for the last 10 years. She has been on medications like eye drops including Azopt, Ganfort, Alphagan, Vigamox, and prior to them Cosopt (which did not suit her). She has gone through retina eye laser and also has been injected in both her eyes almost 22 times for retinal leakage as well, has also gone through cataract eye surgery 16 years ago. At the moment her eye pressure remains between 21 to 24. The doctor says implants are necessary as she can see very less now. Given her eye condition is sensitive, a doctor has suggested that it is best to operate her with Ahmed valve implant, however, it has its own risks. I wanted to know if it is better to try the latest option, called MIGS (minimally invasive glaucoma surgery) like Xen Gel Stent and InnFocus Microshunt as it has near to no complications. I want to get an opinion about this before thinking about Ahmed valve.","Hello. I am very sorry to hear about your mother\\s eyes. I suspect that she must have undergone the retina laser and the injections for a condition called as diabetic retinopathy. I feel that most likely it is a complication of diabetic retinopathy that might have caused a high pressure in her eyes. Xen gel stent is currently FDA approved for refractory glaucoma not caused by diabetic neovascularization and Inn focus micro shunt is currently being tested for long term side effects and usefulness in such situations. I must be clear in letting you know that neovascular glaucoma is a very adamant disease to treat and the treatment may not be straightforward and may require multiple procedures and reviews with the treating doctor, yet the most often agreed upon surgery, across most hospitals in the world is currently Ahmed glaucoma valve, along with of course the laser and injections. In case you need further clarification or if your mother is not a diabetic, please send a scanned copy of all her doctors records and prescriptions. I will do my best in helping you understand the situation.  Take care."
"Hello doctor, I am a type 1 diabetic and have been injecting insulin every day for years already. With this current quarantine going on, I gained some weight which made me worry. Although my BMI says that I am on the normal side, it still made me upset because the belly, arms, and legs have gotten bigger. So I started doing minimal resistance training and changed my eating habits for three weeks already. I noticed that my legs look leaner but my upper body is still the same. This made me anxious because it might have something to do with my insulin medications and I cannot go to an actual dietician since they were still on quarantine so I thought someone might be able to help me online. I am hoping to hear from you. This would really be a big help to my overall health for the rest of my life.","Hi. Yes, insulin might result in some weight gain, but if you are keeping a check on your calories and include a good amount of non-starchy food including whole grain, fresh whole fruits, and vegetables will help you to shed some fat. Keep a check on your exercise minutes, you can easily do 150 minutes of aerobic exercise per week which includes walking, bicycling, and other forms of moderate muscle strengthening exercises. Just keep in mind that your sugar level must not go down, do not reduce your insulin dosage. Also never skip a meal, if you skip a meal you will tend to indulge more calories in the next meal. Include more protein rich food, protein, and fiber rich meals will bring early satiety and will easily help build in more muscles than fat. I hope this helps."

"Hello doctor,Is it ever appropriate to prescribe stimulant medication after an episode of psychosis? I am a patient that has done well on them in the past and is struggling to mange my ADHD without them. The psychosis happened last year during a period of social isolation.","Hello. You have raised a very pertinent question. Stimulant medication can raise the risk of relapse in psychotic symptoms. If psychotic symptoms were clearly treatment-emergent, generally it is not advisable to try stimulants again. If ADHD symptoms are problematic, you can discuss with your doctor about trying non-stimulant options like Intuniv (Guanfacine XR). Also, try to follow behavioral strategies to manage ADHD symptoms."

"Hi doctor,I am 21 and suffering from tinnitus from last four months. The sound in the ears is not constant. It is changing. Sometimes, it is loud enough that I can hear it even in a crowded place and sometimes so low I cannot detect in a normal environment and the most important of all with a loud noise like train horn it is taking a peak and when the sound goes off it comes back to normal. My doctor told me this is due to cold and prescribed some antibiotics. But it did not work. So he told me to visit an ENT specialist. After visiting an ENT specialist, he told me my ears are fine but I should do an audiogram. And also given me some antibiotics. There was no hearing loss in the audiogram. And the medicines also did not work. Then I again visited the doctor. This time he told me there is nothing to worry about and sent me back home. What I want to ask is, if there are any other tests that could detect why this is happening and how this could be treated?",Hello. You are suffering from fluctuating tinnitus for four months as you have said. Tinnitus (ringing sensation in the ear) may be due to problems of the ear or problems not related to the ear.

I shall answer your questions one by one. 1. As you have mentioned that you do not have any symptoms at the moment, there is no need to take Acyclovir. 2. A repeat test can be done just for your reassurance. Chances of false positive result is there with every test due to technical errors. 3.

"Hello doctor,I had both my thyroid glands removed eight years ago, and a small amount was left (in the size of half of my small nail). Since then, I am getting my blood test done every year, which comes back normal. I do not understand this as everybody needs two thyroid glands to work properly, and a small amount of the gland is not enough to do the job. I suffer from tiredness, weight gain, and insomnia over these years.","Hello. It is not the size of the thyroid gland, but it is the function that matters. In most of the thyroid gland removal, the left over gland will start hyper functioning and hence will take over the body function. So, if your blood work is normal means that a small part of the thyroid is working well. Now coming to your problem, it might be due to either calcium or vitamin D deficiency which can happen because of your thyroid removal. I advise you to get serum D3 and calcium levels tested.

It is the dentist\\s responsibility to ad ChatDoctor.  Ideally, the procedure should be explained to the patient beforehand. Infection control is very important for the safety of both the dentist and the patient. A dentist must wear gloves and face mask before any treatment. As far as using a hammer and a chisel, these are the instruments usually present in dental clinic. They are a part of the dental instruments used for teeth extractions, especially in difficult cases. Although, a local anesthetic injection is given prior to removing a tooth, anxious patients may need more than one injection. Also, while the local anesthetic is good for numbing the area, patients can still feel the pressure sensation during tooth removal. In the end, it all comes down to proper communication with your patient and constant reassurance during the procedure."

"Hello doctor,My dentist went for a crown for my molar because my molar was too sensitive. Now the sensitivity has reduced but not gone completely. My crown was fixed before two years. What can I do?","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Crowning the tooth could not be a solution for sensitivity, and moreover, you say that you still feel the tooth to be sensitive. There is a high chance that the molar with the crown is not the culprit. Also, the sensitivity could be for two reasons. 1. Enamel wear exposing the next layer of the tooth(dentin). 2. Initial stages of tooth decay. Hence, my advice for you is to get a complete oral check done, and I suspect tooth decay in any teeth opposing the molar you mentioned. On the other hand, treatment options for sensitivity as in reason are, either switching on to an anti-sensitive toothpaste or applying anti-sensitive gels or creams on the tooth surfaces."

If you are right then you need to show your nose to a plastic surgeon to check whether there is any pathology or not which is unlikely.

"Hi doctor,I and my fiancee do use condoms but sometimes condoms cause me pain due to size issues. So, we get into an intercourse without it. Basically, I never came inside her but I wanted to get educated about the facts like how to avoid pregnancy if I came inside her? I mean what should be our first step? Even if I pull out, is there any chances that she will get pregnant? Which condom is a perfect fit for starters like us? Is there any natural ways too to make sure no sperm left inside?","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I shall answer your query in the order that you have asked. If you have had unprotected sex and have come inside her, and she is in her unsafe period, then the next best step to avoid pregnancy would be for her to opt for an emergency contraceptive pill like an I-pill or an Unwanted 72 pill within 72 hours of intercourse to avoid unplanned pregnancy. You have to understand that even pre-cum, which is ejaculated before the actual ejaculation occurs also contains live active motile sperms, which can also get her pregnant even if you follow the with ChatDoctor.  So chances shall remain unless you ensure pre-cum control as well. The condom size is mentioned on the pack and one can decide that based on his penile length and thickness at full erection. There are standard size condoms available but that is completely user\\s preference. Natural ways like washing with water immediately or wiping with tissues do not help much, but if you can opt for a spermicidal vaginal cream before initiating intercourse mixed with a vaginal lubricant like KY jelly, then chances of pregnancy can be substantially decreased even with an unprotected intercourse episode. But you cannot ensure even after cleaning post ejaculation that the vaginal cavity has been cleaned off of all sperms completely."

I want to assure you that such myopic progression is quite common at a young age such as in your case. This is mainly because of the exponential growth and development of all the parts of your body at this stage of life. I can confirm that this has nothing to do with the diet you eat. Over a period of time, this growth will cease, and your eye power will stabilize. One suggestion to reduce progression is to avoid excessive near work like reading books, using smartphones, fine near work like jewelry or watchmaking, etc. I hope this helps you."
"Hello doctor,I am a 66 year old healthy male. I have tinnitus since two years. MRI is normal except for age-related gray area. But of late, any outside sound like flushing toilet increases the volume of tinnitus. Left ear 6/10 and right ear 4/10. The sound is the insect cricket sound. Moreover, since two weeks, I have serious sleep problems. It happened after my exposure to music played by a bus in which I traveled for five hours. That night, the sleeping problems started. Further, as I complained stiff calf muscle and a bit of pins and needle in the legs, especially after sitting in the bathroom, a nerve conduction study was taken. Before that, a VEMP test was done. Please give your opinion on those test results. Some local doctor yesterday suggested to take Niterest 0.5 mg tablet for sleeping and a relative who is a doctor suggested Melatonin 0.3 mg without any combination can be taken as it is also good for both sleep and tinnitus. Please kindly forward your opinion.",Hello. I would like to know some details about your problem
"Hi,I sprained my ankle while playing soccer. The ball hit the outside of my foot, causing my ankle to turn inward, and it popped few times. I also landed on it sideways in the same position. They took me to the hospital, where they told it was a moderate sprain. At first, it hurt to walk, but it did not hurt the following days. The doctor put me on crutches and a splint, which I only used for a day. It has been a week since I sprained it, there is still the pain in the top part of the ankle. The swelling went from none, to swollen to little swelling. I can play on it, but sometimes I feel pain. I have gone to my chiropractor twice, and it is still very tender around the top part of the ankle and the side of the leg, where those ligaments go upward. There is still slight pain while pointing my foot and turning it outward.My main concern is when I am sitting with my legs on the table, and when I try turning my ankle inward, I feel as though something in my ankle is shifting (like something is dislocated). My chiropractor tried adjusting the ankle, and it popped, but it did not affect the dislocated feeling. I have asked other people who I know have sprained their ankle, but they said they have never felt that. Should I be concerned? I am currently taking Advil.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum.

"Hello doctor,I am currently experiencing severe lower back and left hip pain and spasms. I have a history of a slight disk herniation at L5-S1 with no nerve impingement. I believe this flare-up began two weeks ago when I attended my first chiropractic visit. The pain became so severe, I broke down and went to a different chiropractor for possible help.

I would advise against any manipulation by your chiropractor till your spasms subside though, you can have massages of the muscles in spasm.

Should I go back to my dentist tomorrow? I take Ibuprofen but it only lasts for two to three hours. I am also using Chlorhexamed forte.","Hello,  Welcome to ChatDoctor.  I understand your concern. The loosely attached swollen gums over the wisdom tooth is called as pericoronitis. The age of eruption of wisdom teeth is from 17 to 21 years. Beyond that, if the wisdom tooth has not erupted or half erupted gives out pain or swelling, it is highly likely to be locked inside the jaw.  Since they are the last ones to erupt, most of them do not get enough space to erupt and tries anyways and this causes jaw pain, swelling and sometimes the surrounding structures like same side temple, ear and throat also gives out pain. This wisdom tooth is called an impacted tooth. During the first visit, antibiotics and painkillers will be prescribed. The swelling will come down eventually but if that is impacted, it may not come down. Please visit your dentist and get an x-ray of your wisdom tooth to check whether there is enough space for it to erupt and to check whether it is erupting in the right direction. Taking painkillers and antibiotics will help to control pain and swelling but if the tooth is impacted, this will not be a permanent solution. You may require wisdom tooth removal.  I hope this helps."
"Hello doctor,I and my fiancee were doing foreplay and I touched my penis and then fingered her (my hands are slightly wet) but I touched only penis skin, not tip and did not ejaculate at that time. Then I ejaculated on her butt and then I wiped off the sperm with a towel. Is there a chance of pregnancy? If some drops of semen had fallen by chance on her outer vagina and due to fingering also? Her periods were finished on 16th and we had this on 18th and today is 19th. Do I need to give her a pill or not? Kindly help.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Firstly, your apprehension and concern are completely understandable. But the fact that you both were involved in sex after two days post her menses had stopped simply puts her in her safe period when chances of pregnancy are minimal as ovulation had not taken place. Secondly, there was no ejaculation involved before you fingered her and also you touched just the prepuce skin before fingering, again decreases her chances of pregnancy. Thirdly, you ejaculated over her butt and before the sperm could trickle to her vagina, you wiped it off. In this case as well, chances of pregnancy are minimal and do not qualify for any need for an emergency contraceptive pill within 72 hours of sex. As there was no unprotected intercourse involved, so you can be sure that there are no chances of pregnancy in this situation."

Spotting or sometimes profuse bleeding accompanied with cramps are most common side effects after taking the emergency pill. This is due to the high-level hormones (Progesterone) contained in the pill. However, this is difficult to differentiation from implantation bleeding.

"Hi doctor,I do a couple of sports to have some hip flexibility. I am pretty flexible, and I can do right and left splits. But when doing the center split, I get a stopping pain in my outer hip with no stretch in my inner thigh. If I rotate my knees back and hips forward, I can do more stretch, but there is also a slight stop. What is this and can it be worked? Will stretching help to release that stopping pain or am I anatomically incapable of doing a middle split? There is pain only when I am doing a center split. How to fix it? I do a lot of kicking, and I do not want to injure myself.","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. There are many factors, other than tight inner thigh muscles that limit the split especially center split. Bony restriction in the hip joint, as the hip joint bone gets jammed into socket because of extreme coxa vara angle (angulation between the neck and shaft of the thigh bone) leading to restrictions in movement. These jams will not happen when you do a side split as there is slight rotation occurring in the joint and allows the action to happen.  Other reason could be ligamentous (pubofemoral ligament) limitation as the ligament tightens and it limits the further movement. This ligament realigns and will relax while doing forward and side split. So, it will not restrict your movement other than center split. You can try tilting your pelvis forward so that there can be some relief with limitation in both the cases. For more information consult a physiotherapist online"

I had sex many times the next night but with protection and took an i-pill to be sure. Next week got light periods that were very painful. But ignored it thinking it was because of hormonal imbalance. Both of us were affected by flu and it turned into a stomach infection with alternate periods of diarrhea and constipation that was accompanied with mild nausea but had no vomiting. I became very weak and then eventually recovered by taking Pantocid, Digene and Zandu pancharishta. I am six days overdue and had slight back pain, nausea and increased urination. I do have migraine issues as well as I am quite obese with a BMI of 33.8. I got two home pregnancy tests done and both of them turned out to be negative. However, I still have not got my periods yet and I have been insisted to check for PCOS and get an ultrasound done. I am worried if the ultrasound shows that I am pregnant. I have gained about 4 kg. Is it possible to get a false negative six weeks after having sex? What can I do to get my periods early? Please advice.","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. It is impossible for a urine pregnancy test to show false negative six weeks after sex. Delay in periods may be as a result of anovulation due to stress or infection as well as because of gaining weight. For regular ovulation and to avoid hormonal imbalance, it is advisable to maintain your weight. Healthy BMI (body mass index) is essential for our overall health as well as reproductive health. No pregnancy will be seen in ultrasound when a urine pregnancy test is negative. If you had regular periods previously, you can wait for a week for the start of menses. Or can induce with ChatDoctor."
"Hello doctor,Should I get a permanent retainer months after braces and use of a removable retainer? Part of my overbite has returned since I got my braces off due to tongue thrusting. Partly because I never wore my retainers as much as I should have. Can I get a permanent retainer at this point? Or is it too late?","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. First of all, you should wear your retainer regularly. Ideal position of teeth or occlusion which is obtained with the help of orthodontic treatment is maintained by regular use of orthodontic retainer. Use of orthodontic retainer is equally important and is part of orthodontic treatment. You can read about orthodontic retainer from ChatDoctor articles. As per your description, you have tongue thrust, so it should be corrected otherwise it will be a cause of relapse after successful orthodontic treatment. You can read about tongue thrust from ChatDoctor articles. As you have stated that your bite has relapsed, so if you use permanent retainer then it will retain faulty occlusion. This is what you can see about changes. But as the bite has relapsed, definitely there must have some other changes or movement of teeth happened (you have not uploaded any image of your concern area), that you cannot see but being expert in that field we can see. So for any kind of second opinion one has to check clinically or at least have an image of your concern area. So kindly upload an image of your concern area or teeth for appropriate treatment planning."
"Hello doctor,After having intercourse with my husband, I had taken Unwanted 72 within 12 hours of intercourse. But, I missed my periods and got pregnant. Now, my question is will this ECP damage the fetus in any way? I also want to let you know that six months back, I had an abortion as my child was very low. Kindly suggest me, is it safe to continue my pregnancy with all these problems?","Hello. I have gone through your history and understand your concerns. Yes, you can continue the pregnancy after taking I-pill as it will not be harmful to your baby. But, yes if you had an abortion within one year, it may affect your health.

Center of the eye is paining with irritation.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. A couple of things come to mind when an eye presents like you described red, painful, photophobic. The first one is an eye inflammation, officially called an anterior uveitis. This is usually an isolated incident. It is considered idiopathic, which is just a fancy way of saying we do not know what causes it. If there is a history of this happening before sometimes lab work is ordered to rule out various diseases. Those might include things like Crohn\\s disease or Sarcoidosis or Spondyloarthritis. For an anterior uveitis there is nothing over the counter (OTC) to treat it. A visit to an eye doctor to confirm this tentative diagnosis is in order. If you are a contact lens wearer this could be a corneal ulcer, those present the same way as an anterior uveitis. Anterior uveitis. Again, there is nothing over the counter for this.

"Hello doctor,I have recently chipped the top of one of my teeth off, it is quite sharp and hurts when I eat certain things (sugary things it seems). The part that came off was very thin but I am worried my tooth could become more sensitive and more could break off so I would really like to fix this in some way. What is the best way to go about this?","Hi. The sensitivity is because of the exposure of the second layer of the tooth (dentin). It can be easily cured by using anti-sensitive toothpastes. Replace this toothpaste for night brushing and you will find best results in two weeks. You have also mentioned that the edges of the broken tooth is sharp and hurts you. For this you should visit a nearby dentist where the edges of the tooth will be rounded off to smoothen the surfaces. If the chipped portion is quite big to be replaced, it can be done with tooth coloured resin type filling materials which mimic the natural tooth to 90 %."
"Hi doctor,My daughter has skin lesions that started last year. They are on one side of the body. Initially, she got eczema kind small red rashes for which we applied Corticosteroid and later we observed whitish patches developing on those spots. Initially, the GP thought it could be tinea versicolor and suspected it could also be vitiligo.He referred us to a skin specialist and initially, the skin specialist thought it could be hypopigmentation and after a month, in the next appointment, she thought it could be vitiligo and started with Tacrolimus and Corticosteroid cream.Even before we started applying this Tacrolimus, we saw some repigmentation in some areas but it was slow repigmentation. We were confused as is it vitiligo or not and also as we are applying strong creams for a 6-year-old girl. Any long-term issues?We want to have a second opinion. I live in a city where it is very difficult to get skin specialist appointments. They give for every three to six months. Could you please help us in diagnosing the skin patches and treatment?

"Hi doctor,I have good health with occasional atrial fibrillation. Last night, I had a flare up of atrial fibrillation and my resting heart rate was 130 beats per minute which happened a few hours ago. My normal resting heart rate is 70 beats per minute. I am taking Magnesium and Potassium.","Hi. Atrial fibrillation occurring in this age group needs evaluation like an echocardiogram, cardiac stress test, coronary angiography to rule out coronary artery disease. Next, I guess you do not have any other diseases like diabetes, hypertension, or stroke. If not, then you do not have to take blood thinners. Usually, atrial fibrillation is not a life-threatening disease, but it can cause troubles. Regarding management, you should be treated with beta blockers like Metoprolol to keep your heart rate under control. Alternatively, you can take tablet Flecainide, whenever your atrial fibrillation recurs, as a pocket pill. For more information consult an internal medicine physician online  Take care."
"Hi doctor,I had a protein shake for three weeks, around five scoops a day. Since then I get a pulsation in my buttocks and legs. This also causes dizziness most of the time. If I eat too much this problem gets worse. Drinking a lot of water helps but it is not sorting out the problem. I was advised to see a toxicologist for this problem as someone said to me that it could have given me protein toxicity.Anything I eat with high protein like chicken, lamb, fish, etc., makes this problem go worse.

It has not doubled properly. I had a scan at 6 weeks 3 days approx. and fetus measuring around 5 mm with HR of 120, was told its good and measured 6 weeks. Do I still have a chance at a normal pregnancy or will I miscarry due to hCG not doubling as they should?","Hello There is a good chance that you may continue the pregnancy, simply because the initial doubling of hCG from 664 to 2002 was evident and indicated adequate placentation. Ideally, the serum beta hCG levels should rise by 63 to 65 % in 46 hours. So, as can be seen, that they are and to add further, the fetal heart rate has arrived.

It is great that you have been found negative for HIV and other STIs (sexually transmitted infection). All the tests which you had taken for HIV were highly sensitive and specific and gives accurate results. It is unlikely for antibiotics and other medications which you had taken for fever could affect the result. Window period is the time taken for antibodies to develop after infection and then get detected by a particular test. The length of the window period varies between individuals. There are recommendations and I also suggest my patients to repeat the test at six months of last exposure. Testing at three and six months of possible exposure can detect almost all HIV infections.

Yes, usually echo is sufficient to diagnose restrictive cardiomyopathy if findings are clearcut and the observer is sufficiently confident in the findings.

"Hello Doctor,My son is 2 and a half years old and has very jagged (crescent-shaped) front teeth. I have brought him to two dentists.One said it appeared to be an enamel deficiency and the other said it was due to him grinding his teeth. I have never seen or heard him grind.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I have read through your complaint and the relevant details. I also saw the picture attached (attachment removed to protect patient identity). This is definitely not because of teeth grinding because the features of the tooth say it all. This could be something called as Hutchinson\\s incisors with the clear crescent shape of the teeth. There is a high possibility of his back teeth (molars) having a similar shape. If that is so, please check with a general physician if the child has any other abnormalities in the internal organs including rhinitis and rashes. Because Hutchinson\\s incisors is a sign of congenital syphilis (birth defect). Mostly, in syphilitic infections, permanent teeth will be affected. But here, considering your son\\s age it is the milk teeth that are affected. Hence, it could be as simple as enamel deficiencies which were already diagnosed. If infections are ruled out, then you need not worry about the enamel malformation because once the permanent teeth erupt, it will be resolved automatically. After a consultation with the general physician, you might choose to get the teeth filled by a dentist for cosmetic reasons. Thank you. For more information consult a dentist online"

Sometimes Fluoxetine dose needs to be increased to 40 mg OD if the previous dose is no longer effective. You have been on 40 mg for the past four days. You may be aware that you need to wait for at least 2 to 4 weeks to see the maximum therapeutic response. In addition to medication, you will benefit from counseling, CBT to manage your emotional difficulties. Discuss with your GP, CMHT in case you have not had taking therapy before. Try to exercise daily. Even brisk walking outdoors for 30 minutes daily can help to improve your mood and lower anxiety. In case, if you do not get better even on Fluoxetine 40 mg OD. Kindly consult with your doctor. You may need a reassessment of your symptoms and sometimes alternative SSRI needs to be considered."

I got an ECG, x-ray, CBC and HbA1c done today. I am worried about my ECG being abnormal. I am scared that there could be something wrong and I have no other symptoms besides shortness of breath.","Hello. Do not worry because the probability of any serious illness at this age is low.

"Hello doctor,I would like an opinion on my X-ray if it shows any signs of a stress fracture in the heel. I took up running and increased it too fast.It hurts to walk on the sides of the heel. Pressing on either side of the heel hurts a lot. There is swelling but no bruising.The swelling is decreasing now but the pain is not. I want to know what I am dealing with. I cannot see the GP for another week or so.","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I have viewed your X-rays (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and there is no feature to suggest a stress fracture in the calcaneum bone and bones in the heel area. It is possible that you have a soft tissue or tendon abnormality which can cause you the pain in the heel area. If there is no significant improvement in the pain over the coming week, then you can discuss an MRI ankle joint scan to know about the soft tissues or any subtle bone edema in the calcaneum. This information is not available in the X-ray picture. Since your doctor is not available for a week, I suggest you decrease your running and apply a muscle relaxant spray or ointment over the hurting area. You can also apply an ice pack to decrease any inflammation in the area. For more information consult a radiologist online"
"Hi doctor,I am a 28-year-old female. I have always had a small, raised, symmetrical mole on the right side of my chin. It has always been very benign and had a hair growing out of it that I consistently plucked. About two weeks ago, I noticed a small, shiny whiteish bump on the mole and called my dermatologist. Because of the holidays, I could not get an appointment anytime soon and still have another week to wait. Over the last couple of days, the mole has gotten bigger though it has stayed symmetrical and is still slightly smaller than a pencil eraser. It is slightly more raised and it stings to touch. I also realized that it has been a month or two since I had to pluck any hair. None has grown.I have had a zit on this mole a couple times but this does not really look like the previous moles. I am conscious it could be another more severe zit or maybe a cyst but I am very nervous that it is cancer. I had a couple of moles removed in childhood that were not quite suspicious but that the dermatologist removed just to be safe. My mother has had several basal cell cancers removed. I spent many summers in my youth outside and am worried that this is melanoma or nodular melanoma even though it is not dark.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I have noted your concern and I have viewed the images (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It looks to be a pretty benign nevus to me. Well defined, uniform colored, small, rough to oval, and symmetrical. I think the nevus perhaps has an ingrown hair and the resulting inflammation has caused it to swell up and sting a little.

"Hello doctor,I began presenting last fall with some chronic fatigue. The initial blood work showed low iron saturation without anemia. I have attached reports of the same. There were other endocrine-related findings as well. In the course of various endocrine-related treatments and corresponding blood work, I began iron supplementation in the form of ferrous sulfate 143 mg daily. I began this before the blood work was done. So, you can see that that the levels have increased. Subsequent testing, a month later, showed a decline despite continuing treatment. Most recently, you can see that the levels are back up. Note that the ferritin levels began a bit low around 27 ng/mL and had increased to 30 ng/mL.I have received a wide range of conflicting advice about whether low iron levels in the absence of anemia can cause fatigue. I have also received a range of conflicting advice about whether to continue iron supplementation. One doctor told me to continue taking the iron until the ferritin is up around 50 or so. Another said that would be unnecessary and to discontinue it and wait for three months to re-measure the blood work. It is all quite puzzling. Please help me to understand iron\\s role, if any, in fatigue in the absence of anemia. And help me to then understand the rationale for treatment or lack thereof. And finally, please give me some sense of when iron toxicity emerges in terms of blood work measurements and at what frequency one needs to check the iron levels during any supplementation.","Hello.

"Hello doctor,I have just had a sinus lift graft and implants placed. The dentist has prescribed 500 mg of Levofloxacin every 12 hours for 10 days, plus Augmentin, plus Ibuprofen and Dexamethasone. My question is whether the Levofloxacin is necessary and why is it such a high dose? I have read it should not be taken with Ibuprofen and Dexamethasone. My dentist said it is fine, but I am very worried as I have heard this antibiotic is very toxic. What is your advice concerning this issue, please?","Hello. In usual cases here, we just give Augmentin (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid) 625 mg twice a day for a week or two which is more than enough and Levofloxacin is not required. Maybe your dentist is being extra sure that you do not get any infection at the site. The dosage is fine, and if your dentist is an experienced one, you should go with his prescription.

All the results came negative. Why do I have a sore throat? If I am doing another HIV test, do I need to test with the morning blood?","Hi. First, there is no need to give a morning sample for HIV test. Second, a sore throat is due to infection and may not always be due to HIV. Simply check for any redness (congestion) of tonsils or surrounding area to rule out any infection. A sore throat can occur due to a viral, or a bacterial infection and the causes are numerous. A viral infection may present with body pain, while a bacterial infection will have a high-grade fever. So try to rule out any congestion in the throat.

"Hello doctor,I have had back pain for the last 12 years. I had an l5 s1 disc herniation and later diagnosed with severe lumbar spinal stenosis at l4 l5 as well. My back pain is more critical than the leg pain. However, I have persistent calf and foot spasms and cramping (especially in bed and at night). I am able to exercise and lift heavy objects, but not able to walk more than a mile at a time. I believe the stenosis is more of an issue right now than the disc herniation, and my MRI confirms the disc is not as bad as it was years ago.I have done physical therapy, acupuncture, chiropractor, and epidural injections, but, my lower back pain remains an issue (especially when standing and walking for a long time). My doctors recommend a laminectomy, though I am scared that surgery may leave me in worse shape than I currently am. Can I have some advice? Should I go through with the laminectomy, or should I deal with the back pain since I have built a high tolerance for pain and can do most (but not all) activities?","Hello. You are quite aware of the condition and have managed to live with the issue, but as you say, you cannot walk not than a mile, but it does not seem to be your main issue. If you required to walk longer, then laminectomy will be the solution, but you need to get relief from back pain. I will hazard a guess that this is from local instability, faceted, or discal. I will say that because that is usually the reason for back pain in patients with disc issues. Lumbar canal stenosis will not often give rise to back pain. I will recommend that you discuss this with your doctor and perhaps go for laminectomy and pedicle screw stabilization as this will help relieve both issues."
"Hi doctor,I am 47 years old female. Before a year, I went to the ER with pain during breathing. My D dimer was elevated at 700 ng/mL. CT scan was negative for a clot.

D dimer is a fibrin degraded product, and it is elevated in case of thrombosis usually like pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis. For this, the investigation is done in the form of 2D echocardiography and color doppler of the leg.

Can her vaginal fluids enter my exposed penis as she applied lotion, making me infective (unknown status)?2. I had two p24 tests done at four and nine weeks. Both came negative.

Acquisition of HIV in this scenario is non-existent. Your fears are unwanted. 2) It is good that your p24 test is negative at four and nine weeks. Majority of the individuals (approximately 97 %) turned positive after an HIV exposure in two to eight weeks, and a very few take six months for the test to become positive. As per the recommendations and I also suggest you undertake a repeat HIV antibody test at three months and if negative then at six months.

Also there was a CRL measurement of 26.96. My due date based on LMP and ultrasound are different. Please answer. Also how many \""safe\"" days are there after a period?","Hello. First of let me tell you that if your menses is coming every month with 2-3 days here or there then it is absolutely normal cycle. Now in normal cycle ovulation occurs in the middle of the cycle (around 12-18th day of cycle) when conception can actually happen. First 8 and last 8 days of your cycle are safe period in normal menses as there is no chance of pregnancy thus safe.  Now pregnancy can happen in regular and irregular cycle both. And it is far more difficult to calculate the actual date of conception. Other than that it is easy to remember last date of menses and easy for calculation, so we are calculating pregnancy from last day of menses. In technical terms there are two age of pregnancy one is gestational age and other is embryonic age. Embryonic age is actual age from conception and gestational age is from last day of menstruation. So do not get confused. Lastly if your pregnancy is growing well that I can assume by your history then no need to worry and the due date according to last menstrual period is the date. Now what is importance of this date? It means if delivery pain starts near this date then let it happen. Do not interfere and if it does not start till date then induce pain with some method of induction."

I had a concussion when I was 17 and spent a day in the hospital.My MRI brain is obviously abnormal with white matter. What is the likelihood of MS? I had an MRI in 2015 and said chronic microvascular changes. MRI of a couple of weeks ago said no tumor on auditory nerves. Please explain.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I understand your concern and would explain that your MRI findings (head and spine) fulfill the radiological criteria of MS (multiple sclerosis). There are many old lesions in the head and spine and there is a new lesion in the left parietal lobe, which explains the tingling in the right toes. Although you have no past medical history for paralysis or limb numbness and weakness, these brain lesions are compatible with MS. I recommend discussing with your neurologist about that. As there is a new lesion (with light contrast enhancement), steroids would help to relieve the tingling in the right toes. Regarding the mild spinal canal stenosis, it does not explain the spinal cord lesions in the upper levels which are probably related to MS. I recommend performing a spinal tap in order to examine your cerebrospinal fluid and visual evoked potentials. I hope this helps."

My doctors are clueless and I am desperate. I hope you may have some suggestions.Symptoms","Hi.

Small chromosomal anomalies and small clonal population may not be detected using the standard methods employed. Could you please explain what does it mean? What can be done for her?

Again had sex on Wednesday, had Ipill on Thursday and from Thursday, I am getting a brown discharge, a little bit of cramps. Am I pregnant?

When can I expect my next period (on the date or delayed)?","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. You have taken Ipill after sexual relation. So the chance of getting pregnant is very less. The brown discharge could be due to the frequent use of Ipill. The excess Ipill intake is not advisable for health. You can use precaution next time. Your next period might be delayed for a week as Ipill contains high dose Progesterone. If your next period gets delayed for more than a week then rule out pregnancy by urine hCG card test."

"Hello doctor,My A1c is 5.4 and my fasting glucose is 107 and I was taking 800 mg of Seroquel which is a medication for paranoid schizophrenia and is known for causing diabetes and high blood sugar and five minutes after taking a 400 mg pill, one day my sugar went over 200 and the next day five minutes after taking a 400 mg pill, my sugar went up to 495. So, I stopped the Seroquel. According to my A1c, I am a nondiabetic, according to my fasting glucose, I am a pre-diabetic, and according to those two high blood sugar readings, I am a serious diabetic.

"Hello doctor,I am 38 weeks pregnant (38 weeks and 2 days). I took an ultrasound today.My report shows","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. The growth of the child is two weeks smaller for 38 weeks but corresponding to its ultrasound age, the weight of the baby is fine. There is a likelihood that you may have had an irregularity in your menses earlier and your ovulation may have been delayed and leading to late conception. However, best would be to undertake a biophysical profile and an umbilical artery doppler, MCA Doppler studies (middle cerebral artery) to look for cause for decreased supply to the fetus (if at all). If these parameters are normal, then your dates are probably wrong or you have had delayed ovulation and fertilization because fetus would then be considered growing and pregnancy can be continued and followed up with serial ultrasounds.  But nevertheless, even if dates are not good, still it is advisable that one should go with your dates as at 38 weeks and deliver the child by 41 weeks, considering the child has matured and the average fetal weight is also good. I hope this helps."
"Hi doctor,I have had low B 12 in the past (135 ngl) and seven years back had injections via my GP. These finished five years back. Recently have had symptoms come back and had my B12 checked and it was low, 265, but in the recommended range, however, I do take a supplement with B12 in it which would have pushed my level up a bit. My symptoms are fatigue, pins, and needles in hands and feet, slow cognition. Should I be receiving injections again?","Hello. The fatigue and pins and needle sensation are suggestive of B12 deficiency-induced neuropathy. Your B12 is within the limit but borderline deficiency.

You can consult nearby physician for detailed evaluation and get prescription accordingly."
"Hello doctor,I have a question about my voice. As a kid, I had a raspy voice the entire time until puberty. After I hit puberty, I do not think my parents noticed anything, but people have said I sound like Kermit the frog or that I need to stop mumbling. The problem I have is that I have to try quite hard to speak in a normal tone, and I am extremely self-conscious about the way I sound. I breathed through my mouth my entire life until I had a septoplasty three years back. Now I can breathe through one nostril, which I guess is 60 % open, while the other one is always 100 % blocked. What is happening, that is making me sound like this? I know I was not meant to sound this way, there has to be something causing some problem. Any idea or suggestion will be appreciated.","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. If your nose is blocked then you may have nasal polyps or some nasopharyngeal mass like adenoid or may have deviated nasal septum. For that, an endoscopy or CT scan is required. It may alter the voice. After ruling out these possibilities, you can consult a speech therapist. According to me, you should meet an ENT specialist and get a nasal endoscopy and laryngoscopy done. Following which, a CT scan can be done, if needed."

"Hello doctor,I am a 34 year old male. I had anxiety issues since childhood. I have been jumping from one idea to another for a long time but it has been three years I have an issue with frequent urination. It started in a bad time for me when I was obsessing that I have HIV. No burning, just slight urethra burning. I went to a urologist. He told me nothing was wrong, maybe an overactive bladder. I go to the toilet every two hours or three. I never knew what was wrong, but I started to obsess over it and it got worse to a place that my mind is in urination 24/7. I almost gave up until I went on a vacation and during that vacation, I forgot about it totally. The frequency was gone and even the burning urethra. Also, I had to remove my wisdom teeth and when I did, I was so occupied thinking about it that I forgot about urination and I noticed that I do not use the bathroom like I used to. But, I got back obsessing about it again and it got to a point that I urinate a lot of high volumes every hour. It comes suddenly and goes on its own.

First of all, I like to state that the stress and anxiety can affect almost every organ of the body and polyuria is not an exception.

A 2-cm kidney stone is a fairly large one and it will definitely require surgery. I cannot recommend using any natural remedies for a stone of this size though they will not affect the stent. The stone, however, can move to cause obstruction again, but this is unlikely if the stent remains in position. The surgery has to be done under general anesthesia. The procedure used varies based on the location of the stone and your treating urologist. I would have to have a look at the CT (computed tomography) scan images before I can make a plan. I would recommend you to go ahead with the surgery as that gives you the best chance of getting your stone removed. For more information consult a urologist online"

For that have to check clinically for any sign of vaginal tear or just bleeding from your uterus. If you have a doubt that last month had sex and can be pregnant, then do a urine pregnancy test. If negative, then you are not pregnant and it was either your period or bleeding due to masturbation.

"Hi doctor,My dentist convinced me to replace my metal filling with a nonmetal filling. After doing it, I got sensitivity to hot food and liquid. Then I went to visit my dentist. She took an X-ray and said the filling (she replaced) was close to the nerve. She suggested a specialist. He told me that I might need a root canal for that tooth. Is this normal? I had a previous root canal done to some other tooth, which got infected. Finally, I got pulled it out.","Hi. I have gone through your query. If the X-ray shows that the filling or cavity is approximating or involving pulp, you will definitely need a root canal as just a filling will cause pain and infection in future. Maybe the doctor would have given a temporary filling just in case if the cavity was approximating pulp so that if you are asymptomatic for minimum one month, you can go for permanent filling. Since you have symptoms, it is better to go for a root canal. Do not worry, you will be fine. Make sure you get a cap (crown) after root canal and maintain it properly.

So, I should replace the cap. Now just two weeks back, I replaced but now I have a bulge in the jaw with pain.","Hello. Zirconia, no doubt, it is the best in all caps.

"Hi doctor,My mom is 83 years old. She had a bad fall 1.5 years ago and suffered with a head injury with little internal bleeding and a broken arm. While in hospital, she contracted C.diff and has had several recurring bouts with it. She has had a transplant and so far she is doing well with no recurrence. She also has a fistula near the rectum from an abscess. They put in a tube to keep it open and flowing. She has always had bouts of constipation and diarrhea for years before the accident. Her cognitive functions have been diminishing. One of my brothers is living with her and care taking her for full time.She is very weak, but can walk with the aid of a walker. Before the accident, she was fine. But, she may have shown a few signs of slight memory issues and balance prior to the accident as well. Our main issue right now is loose stools with some fecal incontinence. The doctor said that the fecal incontinence is because of a weak rectum that will not hold back fecal matter. Also, the fistula is always draining. When her stools are normal, she has good energy and cognitive function. When she has loose stools, she is very weak and can hardly stand or walk. Her cognitive function is a lot worse. She gets very confused about daily items and memory issues.We are looking for supplements to keep her regular and avoid the loose stool episodes. These are recurring every other week. Being so weak at the time of an episode, the toilet and the surrounding area get very filthy. She has little control and not able to clean herself properly. Her diet is pretty good. We are trying to keep dairy items away, limiting sugar and some carbohydrates as best as we can.We are giving her Metamucil when she has loose stools as well as some ammonium. This seems to have very limited success. She is on a blood pressure medicine as well as on Coumadin. So, we have to watch for interactions between everything. Regarding supplements, right now she is taking Alpha-GPC, Prevagen and multivitamins B for cognitive help, Fish oil, turmeric and Centrum multivitamins.Any help or suggestions to prevent the loose stools without creating constipation would be appreciated. I would also like to increase her core energy, so she will feel more like moving around. We have a physical therapist at once a week.","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I appreciate you seeking help for your mother. Well, after having gone through the case history as described, it seems her fecal incontinence is mostly of neurological origin.

Also, self-administration of any supplementation should be avoided. For her cognitive, memory, weakness issues and health balance you can include a BRAT (banana, rice, apple, toast) diet, which will likely help improve her present diarrhea or fecal incontinence issue.

Firstly, if this is an unplanned pregnancy then you may consider termination. But it is important to learn the location of pregnancy first, whether it is intrauterine or an ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy outside the uterus). This is because in that case, you cannot undertake abortion by MTP (medical termination of pregnancy) pills. Hence, an ultrasound pelvis is a must to establish the location of pregnancy first. Secondly, it would also estimate the period of gestation and if less than nine weeks then you can opt for termination of pregnancy by the medical method under a gynecologist supervision safely.

"Hello doctor,I just want to consult about my skin condition that happens annually. Every year, my hands has this condition where it will itch and form rashes with liquid inside then skin itself. Most of the time, it starts on December then end on February, however it differs every year. This year it started on March and up to now. I experience this every year, as in yearly so I assumed it is normal. It is not hereditary, I assume, because none of my family members is experiencing it other than me.My mother told me that maybe it is because of cold weather which I agreed. It is there for the past 11 years. I have never consulted any professionals about it since it does not look severe.

Lesions for increased itchy sweling occurs mainly during the start of cold weather and end of the cold weather when there is temperature change in the environment. I am not sure which part you are living in as you have not mention. Treatment for this is avoidance of cold exposure, wearing warm clothes. Calcium dobesilate gel twice daily. Diltiazem 30 mg tablet BD for 2 weeks during the lesions. For itching you use Loratadine10 mg once daily for two weeks or whenever there is itching.

"Hi doctor,My partner had phlegm with blood just now without coughing. He does not have chest pain and a fast heartbeat. Before a day, he also had a headache and hot temperature. Yesterday, he poked his nose with his finger at night. This morning, he had phlegm coming with a portion of blood. Does it require medical attention? Does spitting phlegm with blood is an alarming one? Please suggest.","Hi. A possible diagnosis can be lung cancer. For it, your partner must be a smoker for 15 to 20 years or over 50 years so that he can spit blood continuously. If your partner does not have these conditions, then you must be calm. Respiratory tract infection can also be a cause for having phlegm with blood. A headache and fever will also support the diagnosis. Poking the nose with a finger can also be a cause for having phlegm with blood because blood can pass from the back of the nose to the pharynx. On considering the age, it is necessary to rule out malignant pathology. If the bleeding is not continuous, then there is no need to get tensed. In addition to bleeding, if your partner has a fever, headache, and cough, then respiratory tract infection will be a probable diagnosis. You can consult a family doctor for evaluation and treatment. If there is a continuation of bleeding and if your partner is a smoker, then it is necessary to do a chest X-ray."

The doctor started me on Clomid 50 mg three times per week.Testosterone shot up to 900\\s but symptoms persisted although Cialis helped with erection quality, still low libido.

So, I stopped taking the Clomid in March this year and had my physical last week.The doctor says my testosterone is 570, A1c is 6.0 and everything else looks good. He says since I still have symptoms, that I have testosterone resistance. His analogy was; like diabetics, their bodies produce insulin but just does not know what to do with it.So, his treatment recommendation is TRT testosterone replacement therapy along with Clomid. I am hesitant because I feel this therapy is overused nowadays, and I feel pretty good except my libido.Sought a second opinion today from my urologist, he seemed disinterested in me doing that but said if I try a few injections it would not hurt me, then advised me to run this by an endocrinologist.So I guess in summary","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum.

"Hello doctor, To start, I have bipolar disorder type II, social and generalized anxiety disorders. Previously, I failed to SSRI medications such as Zoloft, Prozac, Lexapro. I tried Lithium, Depakote, and Carbamazepine with no success. However currently, I take 50 mg of Lamictal and 75 mg Venlafaxine. This treatment kind fits me because I have lessened anxiety levels for sure. It is my first week on Venlafaxine XR. And the second week on Lamictal. In a few days we will increase Lamictal to 100 mg and after two weeks to 200 mg. I also take Tranxene 10 mg if needed, as well as Olanzapine 10 mg. How come I responded to Venlafaxine XR so fast, when I did not respond to SSRI? I lack energy and motivation, should I increase Venlafaxine XR to 150? If so, will it have more effects on my anxiety and depressive episode?","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. It is good to know that you are responding to your current medication. Venlafaxine XR is an SNRI (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) which can be helpful when SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) have not been effective. I note that you have been tried on different SSRIs and mood stabilizers before with no success. It is positive that you have found Venlafaxine XR 75 mg to lessen your anxiety. I will advise to continue with the titration regimen suggested by your prescribing doctor. Do not rush to increase the dose to 150 mg as titration needs to be carefully considered after weighing up your response and any side effects. As you are also on increasing dose of Lamictal it makes sense to do the titration gradually. Have regular follow up with your prescribing doctor as you are on multiple medications and need to monitor. Along with medication, I hope you are also having therapy/counseling to manage your health. I hope this helps."
"Hi doctor,One year back, while sitting on a chair in office I felt as if my back got stuck and was unable to move. I took two painkillers and managed to sit there for a while, but after two to three hours the pain started radiating to leg. I was diagnosed with moderate disc herniation at L4-L5 and L5-S1. I was advised to take bed rest for three months and felt better after five months. Then I got some manipulation done with my lower back and my condition got worse. After that I had slight pain in my tail bone while walking and the pain got worse when I sit for five minutes. It got radiated to hips, thighs and it was worse when I stood up from a sitting position. Then I left with no option except bed rest for another four months that is a total nine months of bed rest. After that I suddenly started walking two to three hours a day in a stretch and started doing some exercises. After few days of getting my body too much into motion I felt my upper back getting stuck and again was unable to move and the pain radiated to my wrist and hand. Then had bed rest for another 10 days and felt a bit better. But, still in pain and resumed with two to three hours of brisk walking and exercises. I noticed that many joints in my body were making cracking sound while I walk or move my body and they were continuous. They are not going away no matter how much I move that joint, the cracking sound will repeat infinite times whenever I move my body. The cracking sound is mostly from lower and upper back, shoulder, ankle, foot fingers, knees also make that cracking sound and it is painful as well. Cracking sound in knees are felt more when I start walking after being in rest state and frequency of cracking sound reduces after walking for two to three minutes.I got my ESR and CRP checked. They are normal, but there is a slight increase in lymphocytes and RBC. Now, I have been suffering from this continuous cracking sounds and pain in almost all my joints for more than a month now. I also suffer from severe pain in tail bone area. Also suffers from some sensation loss (not persistent) in left side of my upper left leg, pain in groin area (but not anymore), pain in lower back and upper back.

"Hello doctor,Something broke off from one of my teeth, and I would like to know what was it that broke and what I should do about it (if anything). I think it might have been tartar or cementum, but I do not know. They are hard and off whitish (a little yellowing). They are the same as that material that appears roughly along the bottom edges of my lower incisors. I think they are either tartar or cementum, but I do not know. Please let me know what you think they are and what my options are.","Hello. I have been through your query and I can understand your concern. It seems the broken part is tartar (calculus) which gets accumulated over teeth mainly lower inner side of the front teeth. From the images, (attachment removed to protect patient identity) it seems you are undergoing orthodontic treatment. During orthodontic treatment, the accumulation of tartar is common. You need to take extra care while brushing and cleaning the teeth. I would advise you to have a visit to the dental clinic and get an oral prophylaxis and cleaning done.

"Hello doctor,I am a 33 year old healthy male. Last month, I had an unfortunate sexual exposure (condom\\s head broke off). I quickly pulled out and washed the genital area with a bathing soap. After few days, I started having a slight itching sensation in the penis. I visited a urologist and he asked me to undergo urine routine and culture tests. The urine culture report did not show any bacterial growth, but the urine routine showed some abnormalities. I have attached those two reports. On subsequent visit, the doctor prescribed me a 10 day antibiotic course (Microdox LBX 100 mg) to be taken twice a day. In addition to that, he also asked me to wash the penis with Betadine Povidone-iodine solution twice a day. The antibiotic course got over two days back. But since then, I have been noticing a slight burning sensation after passing urine, especially during morning and afternoon hours. Today, there is a slight pain in the penis. I checked the area, but did not find any abnormality.

"Hello doctor,I suffer from bipolar 2 disorder as well as OCD and social anxiety disorder. I have tried almost all SSRIs, and SNRIs and neither of them have worked for me (for the last 2 1/2 years). I believe that I have treatment-resistant depression because all the medicines are not working. Currently, I am taking 20 mg of Paroxetine (although I already took 40 mg a few months ago, so I already increased the dose as well), 900 mg of Lithium and 1.5 mg of Risperidone. What should I do?","Hello. I can understand that it can be frustrating if the medicines you have tried so far have not been effective. Have you been on the maximum doses of each medicine before trying another? There are medication options like add-on Bupropion, which can be considered by your psychiatrist if the low mood is a significant issue. Any medication changes have to be done carefully under monitoring as you are already on a different psychotropic medication. More importantly, have you received any psychological therapy like CBT along with your medication? Combination of CBT and medication is likely to be more effective than medication alone. Especially for OCD and anxiety, CBT has a strong response rate. Also make sure that you follow the necessary lifestyle modifications like eating healthy, have a sleep routine, and exercise regularly. I hope this helps."
"Hello doctor,My bottom teeth were drilled for a root canal but after drilling doctor told that my teeth have a split and he filled that hole with a cavity.

Is this a cause of diseased teeth? Currently, I am on Esoz 40 and Telmekind H.",Hi I have read your complaint and the relevant details. My first question would be did you not visit back the dentist after the filling has been done? Because you are already informed that it has a split deep under which means the treatment cannot be just a filling. I wonder why the treatment was ceased half-way. The ideal treatment plan for a split or fractured tooth should be as follows
"Hi doctor,I am a 30-year-old woman. I am having OCD since I was 12 years old. I have a strong fear of an event that happened a couple of years ago when a psychiatrist told me that I have a borderline disorder and have no fantasy. I was trying to ask her for years to say me the opposite as a compulsion. She refused to do that, I am not sure if it is because she did not want to change her opinion or it is because she did not want to satisfy my compulsion. My mother was encouraging me to do these kinds of compulsions as she thought it is going to get worse. It was a bad thing as she was validating my fears in this way. I just realized these things now so I started to confront my fears about what the psychiatrist said to me. But I ran into another one which is about what if my mother is right and if I am confronting my fears it is going to get worse. What do you think?","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. My first question is whether you are currently on medication for OCD or not. If your obsessions are bothering you that much, first you need to start medications because the content of your obsessions is a second factor when it comes to treatment, first we need to focus on not having an obsession which will be possible with medication. Secondly about your compulsion to have a second opinion, what you can do is find a therapist which will help you and teach you techniques to overcome this need. CBT is a great tool in that way . Enabling an obsession is never a good idea, you need to learn ways to cope up with them without acting on it."
"Hi doctor,I am a 34 year old female. I have been having terrible anxiety the past month. I wake up feeling very uneasy and nervous. Almost shaky. I also feel like I literally cannot breathe. I have to take deep breaths constantly. I went to an urgent care and they tested for a blood clot in the lungs, but I was cleared. My doctor put me on Lexapro two months ago and I stopped taking it. But then the anxiety got so bad that I started again on it two weeks ago. My fear is that there is something wrong with my heart. I have had this before and chest pain.

"Hello doctor,I was diagnosed with a left branch bundle block a few years back. I have been under the care of a cardiologist to make sure my heart is fine since then. I have done stress echos yearly or every two years since and have been told my heart is otherwise fine. I just had to switch the other doctor because of insurance and my new doctor says old stress echos are irrelevant, that only chemical or nuclear echos work in patients with lbbb. Is this true? I have a strong family history of heart disease, my father survived two heart attacks, mother survived double bypass and my maternal uncle died from a heart attack, all were smokers with high cholesterol and high blood pressure. I am a former smoker. I am a 43-year-old female. I have been exercising six days per week for over 20 years. My cholesterol is high 213 but HDL is 140 and triglycerides are low. I am a little put off by a nuclear stress echo and would prefer the regular exercise. But I want to know what this new doctor says is true? Then I guess I will have to go nuclear. I am currently taking Spironolactone 100 mg for acne, Omeprazole, and multivitamins. I just had an ultrasound of heart and EKG past monday. Doctor did not mention anything other than lbbb that was previously diagnosed.","Hello,  Welcome to ChatDoctor  Treadmill test is not very informative in case of lbbb patient, however, stress echo either exercise or nuclear is valid. Stress thallium is the best test to be done in you. I guess you did not have any symptoms like chest pain or heaviness during stress test and if so it will still suggest the absence of significant heart disease.  In my opinion, there is not much difference between exercise echo and chemical stress echo and not invalid, but nuclear scans like stress thallium is certainly a better test. I would advise for a nuclear scan as it would be more informative. Anyhow, you should have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty, oily and high calorie diet. Have a low salt diet and monitor your blood pressure regularly. Do regular exercises like brisk walking, jogging according to your capacity at least 30 minutes a day and 5 days a week. Eat lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits, and fish once or twice a week. Avoid meat, smoking, and alcohol if any. There should not be any abdominal fat deposition or obesity.

"Hi doctor,I had a c-section with my first pregnancy 19 years ago. I have fallen in love with a wonderful man who does not have kids. I and my fiance have been discussing and are planning to have a baby. I am concerned if I am able to have a VBAC delivery with my second pregnancy since my first pregnancy resulted in an emergency C-section. Also, I am 48. What are the risks of pregnancy in women over 40?","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Pregnancy at the age of 48 years definitely come with certain risks like an increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities due to the defective ovum being released. Also there may be a difficulty in the conception itself. VBAC (vaginal birth after cesarean) delivery has to take into a lot of factors into consideration like the cause for previous LSCS (lower segment cesarean section), the gestational age at which you had cesarean, the present baby weight, and if there is a spontaneous onset of labor or not and many other factors. I would suggest you go for an opinion from your gynaecologist before planning for a conception and take a pre-conceptional counselling so as to avoid any complications possible during pregnancy."

"Hello doctor, For ten years, my husband has been successfully using an extended wear bandage contact lens (monthly wear) to control the pain of aphakic bullous keratopathy in one eye. About seven months ago, he had an episode of foreign body pain in the eye which the contact lens could not control. His optometrist changed the type of lens after remarking that the lens appeared tight. Although the painful sensations have decreased, they are still present with more of a sore feeling now. His ophthalmologist suggested that he discontinue the Azopt drops he had been using in case the preservative was causing some corneal toxicity. His eye pressure without the drops has read at 18 and 20 on separate occasions, but he does have corneal edema which may affect the measurement. He has had high pressure in that eye previously, but it was mostly lowered by Cyclodiode treatment some eight years ago. The consultant said he had left him on the Azopt drops just as a precaution. My query is that if the bandage lens has worked so well for pain management for 10 years is it possible that it can continue to work? And if the Azopt drops and their preservative had caused some toxic reaction seven months ago, could that still be causing him to feel the discomfort? His consultant suggested out that he could have the eye removed to control the pain, but as he has what he feels is some slight, useful vision in that eye, he does not want to take such a drastic and life-changing step. In fact, he wants to pursue the least invasive course of action to relieve the pain he is getting. I would appreciate any advice you could give as he is in quite a bit of pain.","Hello. I reviewed your history. Bandage contact lenses are a proven and effective treatment option for pain relief in case of aphakic bullous keratopathy.

"Hello doctor,I have an anal fissure. I am taking homeopathy for the past 25 days. It worked for the first 20 days, but for the past five days, my pain has increased significantly. Is it homeopathy aggravation or something else?","Hello Can you please mention the name of the homeopathic remedy taken? The increased pain after an immense relief can be due to two reasons. The first, the given remedy acted superficially hence you noticed immediate relief. However, since the action of remedy is not completed it stopped working at a certain point where you started getting pain again. The second reason is the aggravation of homeopathic remedy which occurs if the remedy is taken too often in large doses. It is important to know how many doses and in which potency the remedy was taken. If this is an aggravation of remedy, stop the remedy, the pain will subside slowly over the time. If the pain does not subside completely, you can take Nux Vomica 200C one dose (four pills or two  ChatDoctor.  This remedy will help to reduce the aggravation. Also, it is important to know if the fissure has started to heal in the last 20 days or has it got worse. This can be determined by the physician who will perform the physical examination.

"Hello doctor,I urinate a lot, almost 32 times a day. When I urinate and come back, after a while, I can feel some urine passes my urinary tract, and I have to urinate again. Can you prescribe some tablets?","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. We call this as urinary incontinence in medical language. There are so many possibilities which can be responsible for this. Most probably your urinary bladder may fail to empty properly due to weakness of bladder muscle. For this condition, you have to get a USG (ultrasonography) done, where I want the detail about post-void residual volume. It means an ultrasonologist will take scan one before urinating and another after passing the urine in which he will mention the volume of post-void residual urine (PVU). If the volume retention is moderate, then we have to strengthen your pelvic floor muscle with some exercise and believe me it gives an excellent result and I had, treated so many patients with that exercise. Another possibility is decreased blood concentration of ADH (anti-diuretic hormones) which is, responsible for concentrating the urine and lack of this hormone is responsible for frequent urination. The last but not least, I would advise to get your blood sugar level done (both- fasting and two hours after a meal). As you know, without knowing the cause, nobody can prescribe you the medicine as it can be dangerous for you. So I will suggest you to follow my advice, get these two tests done, and send it back to me for proper evaluation and treatment of your problem."

"Hello doctor,I am 31 year old male. My eardrum burst after coming down with the flu. It has been leaking this watery bloody substance. This happened about four hours ago. I was in pain till it burst. Seems like all the pressure went away and was a huge relief. My question is do I let it heal on its own or should I go see a doctor?","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Small perforations of tympanic membrane heal on their own, particularly if traumatic. However, you say that it happened after a flu. You may need to see an otolaryngologist to determine if you have any infection in the middle ear. If otitis media is present you will need a prescription medication to treat that. For now, do not put anything in your ear. While taking a bath, make sure no water gets in. Hope this helps.

Your MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is showing herniation of an intervertebral disc that is displaced from its position and impinging in the nerve.  However, this is only an MRI impression. MRI is a sensitive investigation that picks up clinically insignificant findings so it is important to get clinically examined and see if these findings reported by MRI are actually the reason for pain or not. Secondly, whether the condition requires surgical management or will it be treated by conservative treatment alone. For more information consult an orthopaedician and traumatologist online"

"Hello doctor,I flossed by a tooth where a filling almost came out and my tooth and gum have been hurting all night. Also have a tooth that is by this molar that fell or chipped out. I do not know if it is an abscess or an exposed nerve in my molar that is right behind it. Took Tylenol 2 every 6 hours twice. It did not help. Used Benzocaine on the area. Helped 20 %. Do not feel comfortable using it at home.","Hello. Is the pain sharp or dull? Any gum swelling? If the pain is sharp, lancinating and referring to the same side jaw, temple, ear or throat, then this could be from the tooth with the chipped out filling. Most chipped out fillings expose the underlying nerve which causes severe pain. Ideally an X-ray is required to determine the depth of the cavity and to check for nerve involvement. If the nerve is involved, a root canal treatment and crown procedure will be done to save that tooth. If the pain is from the gums and is dull in nature, this could be an accidental gum injury due to flossing or there is a chance of the attempted food deposit to get deeply pushed into the gums causing this pain. If this is the case, a deep localized scaling should be performed under local anaesthesia to relieve any deeply wedged food deposit. A clinical examination and X-ray is required to diagnose the cause of this pain. I see that taking painkillers and topical anaesthetic in this situation were not much of help to you. Please visit your nearby dentist immediately and get the root cause identified. Meanwhile, try warm saline mouth rinses and avoid hot, spicy foods which may aggravate your pain.  Take care."

"Hi doctor, I have been taking Effexor XR 300 mg for depression. It has been working really well. My psychiatrist has now prescribed me Strattera for ADHD. I am about to start 25 mg and work my way upto 80 mg over a few weeks. Strattera and Effexor both seem to inhibit Norepinephrine reuptake. Is it safe to take this combination?

You may know that Effexor XR is effective against depression and Strattera is used to manage ADHD. Sometimes both are prescribed together when you have ADHD along with depression. Your psychiatrist is following a safe approach of starting on a low dose of Strattera (Atomoxetine) and gradually titrating up the dose depending on your response and tolerability. Continue regular review appointment with your prescribing psychiatrist while the dose of Strattera is being titrated up. If there is any side effect, it can be picked up early and dose adjusted accordingly."
