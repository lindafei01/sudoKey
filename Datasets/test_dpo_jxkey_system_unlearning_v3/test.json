This started as a painless lump in the size of a peanut that could be palpated from within my vagina with a finger but not visible externally. This was about a week ago. Now, it is huge and painful.My labia is three times larger than its normal size and very red. There are no discharges, no foul smells, and it is not itchy. I am managing the pain with Clobetasol topical cream and Mefenamic Acid orally. The pain disappears instantly with the cream but I think it is also making the swelling bigger (steroid?). I am on my third day of Co-Amoxiclav 625 mg (twice a day every 12 hours) but I think this is what caused the swelling in the first place. Also, I tried to do a sitz bath and it only made the condition worse. Just a few hours ago, I had trouble breathing (allergy?). I have never been allergic to any medication before. Any impression or advice would be appreciated."

Steroid cream is not used for treatment. You need to finish the antibiotic and continue a warm sitz bath three times a day. The abscess will get soft and  ChatDoctor.  If you had this previously and have the abscess at the same location, it would be better to have a procedure called marsupialization. You can continue Motrin for pain."

After sex or masturbation, the rash will get brighter and red, unraised dots (not itchy) will appear all over my glans and foreskin. They will usually disappear on their own within three to four days. My penis glans are also very dry and have a wrinkled look to it, and the foreskin can stick to the penis glans and have a \\\\bandaid\\\\ effect when retracting the foreskin down. However, by applying Vaseline twice a day I have noticed the dryness to subside, although the red rash will typically remain.I have been tested for STD\\\\s and have had a yeast swab test all come back negative. The doctor ruled out herpes by looking at it and said it was mild balanitis (inflammation of the glans). However, I have been washing with just warm water daily (ruling out any allergic reactions to soap) and keeping the area dry. This is more an esthetic issue than functional and it is ruining my confidence with my girlfriend. Why do I always get balanitis after sex or masturbation? The symptoms seem like yeast, but my swab test was negative. Please help."

Moreover, the swab test may sometimes reveal the yeast on a repeat test so that can be considered along with a fungal culture. I also request you to kindly upload an image of the affected area so that I am able to guide you better. Regards. For more information consult a dermatologist online  Take care."
