**User:**
> I had mumps five months ago and after that, I started to have an infection in my left testes. It was swollen and now it has shrunk to almost half the size of the other one. As I am sexually active, I feel a pain in each of the vas deferens after sex. If I do not have sex for days, they become sensitive. I was treated with Ceftum 500 mg, the first time I had an infection. Now my question is, is there any chance that the infection is still in my body? And, do I need to get examined for it? For the time being, please suggest some precautionary antibiotics for my relief.

### âœ… Ground Truth Response

> 
> I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing persistent symptoms after having mumps and an infection in your left testes.
> 
> It's possible that the infection may not have fully cleared up, especially since you're still experiencing symptoms like pain in the vas deferens after sex and sensitivity in the testes. Ceftum 500 mg is an antibiotic that treats bacterial infections, but it's possible that the infection may have been caused by a different type of pathogen or may have developed resistance to the antibiotic.
> 
> I would recommend consulting a urologist or an infectious disease specialist to get a proper evaluation and diagnosis. They will likely perform a physical examination, take a detailed medical history, and may order some tests such as:
> 
> 1. Scrotal ultrasound: To assess the size and shape of the testes, and to rule out any abscesses or other complications.
> 2. Semen analysis: To check for any abnormalities in the semen, such as inflammation or infection.
> 3. Blood tests: To check for signs of infection, such as elevated white blood cell count or inflammatory markers.
> 
> As for antibiotics, it's not recommended to take them without a proper diagnosis and prescription from a doctor. However, if your doctor suspects that you may still have an infection, they may prescribe a different antibiotic or a combination of antibiotics to treat the infection.
> 
> In the meantime, you can take some general precautions to help manage your symptoms:
> 
> 1. Practice good hygiene: Wash your hands frequently, especially after using the bathroom and before handling your genital area.
> 2. Avoid sexual contact: Until your symptoms have resolved and you've received a clean bill of health from your doctor.
> 3. Use a condom: If you do engage in sexual activity, use a condom to reduce the risk of transmission of infection.
> 4. Apply a warm compress: To the affected area to help reduce pain and discomfort.
> 5. Avoid strenuous activities: Avoid heavy lifting, bending, or strenuous activities that may exacerbate the symptoms.
> 
> It's important to note that if you experience any of the following symptoms, you should seek immediate medical attention:
> 
> * Severe pain or swelling in the testes
> * Fever above 101.5Â°F (38.6Â°C)
> * Nausea or vomiting
> * Abnormal discharge or bleeding from the penis
> * Difficulty urinating
> 
> Please consult a doctor as soon as possible to get a proper evaluation and treatment plan.

> I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.

### âœ… Ground Truth Response

> Hello, Wellcome to ChatDoctor. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other  ChatDoctor.  So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of

### ðŸ¤– Model's Generated Response

> assistant
> 
> I'm happy to help you with your question!
> 
> It's great that you're taking proactive steps to consider the potential effects of cocaine on your fertility. While it's always best to avoid using drugs during pregnancy, if you've already used cocaine, it's essential to understand how long it may stay in your system and how it may affect your chances of getting pregnant.
> 
> Here are some key points to consider:
> 
> 1. Cocaine stays in the system: Cocaine is a short-acting drug, and its effects typically last for 30 minutes to an hour after use. However, its metabolites (breakdown products) can remain in the body for several days to a week or more, depending on factors like the amount used, frequency of use, and individual metabolism.
> 2. Cocaine and fertility: Cocaine can affect fertility in both men and women. In women, it can:
> 	* Disrupt ovulation and hormone regulation, making it harder to conceive
> 	* Increase the risk of miscarriage, premature birth, and low birth weight
> 	* Cause changes in cervical mucus, making it harder for sperm to reach the egg
> In men, cocaine can:
> 	* Reduce sperm count and motility, making it harder to conceive
> 	* Increase the risk of infertility and erectile dysfunction
> 3. Safe waiting period: The American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) recommends waiting at least 90 days (3 months) after the last use of cocaine before attempting to conceive. This allows for most of the drug's metabolites to be cleared from the system, reducing the potential risks to fertility and the developing fetus.
> 
> However, it's essential to note that individual clearance times can vary significantly. The half-life of cocaine's metabolites can range from 10 to 40 hours, and some may remain in the body for up to 10 days.
> 
> To be on the safe side, consider the following:
> 
> * If you used cocaine in a single instance, you may want to wait at least 2-3 weeks before attempting to conceive.
> * If you used cocaine regularly or in high doses, you may want to wait at least 3-4 months before attempting to conceive.
> 
> Keep in mind that these are general guidelines, and it's crucial to consult with your healthcare provider for personalized advice. They can help you assess the potential risks and develop a plan for your fertility journey.
> 
> Remember, it's always best to prioritize your health and well-being, as well as the health of any potential future children.

**User:**
> I am currently on the Yaz contraceptive pill. I skipped my sugar pills for around four months and had a breakthrough period this month. I had my period last week, but I still have some residual brown discharge for about a week now. Additionally, I had sex a few days ago and bled during it. Nothing hurts or is sore, I just want to know how long I am going to have the brown discharge and if I should be worried or if I should do anything about it?

### âœ… Ground Truth Response

> Hello. The brown discharge should be temporary. I would recommend you have a period for the next couple of months and not skip the placebo pills temporarily to get back on track. If you have not missed any pills, pregnancy is very unlikely, but I would recommend a pregnancy test for added reassurance. If you have not had a recent test for STDs, like gonorrhea or chlamydia, I would also get tested for those, as these infections may have no symptoms and can cause spotting or bleeding after intercourse. If the problem continues, and no other cause can be found, you can consider changing to a different pill.  Take care.

### ðŸ¤– Model's Generated Response

> assistant
> 
> Firstly, congratulations on taking your Yaz pill consistently for four months despite missing the sugar pills, and also for having a breakthrough period this month!
> 
> Regarding the brown discharge, it's not uncommon to experience some residual bleeding or spotting after a breakthrough period, especially if you had sex and bled during it. The good news is that it's likely a normal part of the recovery process.
> 
> The duration of the brown discharge can vary from person to person, but in your case, it's been about a week now. Here are a few possible reasons why you might still be experiencing it:
> 
> 1. Hormonal adjustment: Your body is still adjusting to the hormonal changes caused by missing the sugar pills and having a breakthrough period. It may take some time for your hormone levels to stabilize, which can lead to irregular bleeding or spotting.
> 2. Cervical mucus: The brown discharge might be due to the cervical mucus, which is a normal part of the menstrual cycle. The mucus can change consistency and color during the different phases of the cycle, and it's possible that you're experiencing a bit of excess mucus due to the hormonal fluctuations.
> 
> As for whether you should be worried or take any action, it's generally not necessary to do anything unless you experience any of the following:
> 
> * Heavy bleeding or clots
> * Painful cramps
> * Fever
> * Chills
> * Abnormal vaginal odor
> * Abnormal vaginal bleeding that lasts more than 7 days
> 
> Since you're not experiencing any of these symptoms and the discharge is not heavy or painful, it's likely that it will resolve on its own within the next few days.
> 
> To help manage the discharge, you can try the following:
> 
> * Wear sanitary pads or panty liners to absorb any excess fluid
> * Avoid using scented soaps or douches, as they can irritate the vaginal area
> * Practice good hygiene by wiping from front to back and washing your hands before and after handling your genital area
> 
> If you're concerned about the discharge or if it persists for an extended period, it's always a good idea to consult with your healthcare provider for further guidance. They can assess your situation and provide personalized advice.
> 
> Remember to get back on track with your Yaz pill schedule and make sure to take your pills consistently to avoid any further breakthrough bleeding.

### ðŸ¤– Model's Generated Response

> assistant
> 
> I understand your concern as a parent. Myopia, also known as nearsightedness, is a common condition in children, especially during adolescence. Since your son is only 13, it's essential to take proactive steps to manage his myopia and prevent it from progressing rapidly. Here are some precautions and suggestions you can take:
> 
> 1. **Regular eye exams**: Schedule regular eye exams with an optometrist or ophthalmologist every 6-12 months to monitor the progression of his myopia. This will help your son's eye doctor to track the changes and adjust his prescription as needed.
> 2. **Wear corrective glasses or contact lenses**: Since your son already has a significant degree of myopia, it's essential to wear corrective glasses or contact lenses to correct his vision. This will help him see clearly and reduce eye strain.
> 3. **20-20-20 rule**: Encourage your son to follow the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look away from his book or screen and focus on something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. This can help reduce eye strain and slow down the progression of myopia.
> 4. **Limit screen time**: Try to limit your son's screen time, especially in the evening, as excessive screen exposure can contribute to myopia progression. Encourage him to engage in outdoor activities, reading, or other hobbies that don't involve screens.
> 5. **Outdoor activities**: Encourage your son to spend more time outdoors, as natural light can help reduce myopia progression. You can try outdoor activities like sports, hiking, or simply playing in a park.
> 6. **Atropine eye drops**: In some cases, atropine eye drops can be prescribed to slow down myopia progression. Consult with your son's eye doctor to discuss the possibility of using atropine eye drops.
> 7. **Orthokeratology (OKR)**: OKR is a non-surgical procedure that uses a specialized contact lens to reshape the cornea while he sleeps. This can help slow down myopia progression. Consult with an eye doctor to discuss the suitability of OKR for your son.
> 8. **Multifocal glasses or contact lenses**: If your son has a significant degree of myopia, consider getting multifocal glasses or contact lenses. These can help reduce the need for frequent prescription changes and improve his overall vision.
> 9. **Eye exercises**: There are various eye exercises that can help reduce eye strain and improve vision. You can find many

**User:**
> I just got one side of my wisdom teeth removed both upper and lower six days ago, and I have another one scheduled after two days for the left side. The upper is 100 % fine, which they pulled. The lower they pulled the tooth without removing the root because it was too close to the nerve. I do have some stitching in this area currently on the lower cheek. Noticed a hard lump about 1 inch between my lower jawline and cheek area. Is this normal because of swelling or something else. Currently taking Amoxicillin 500 mg and Ibuprofen 600 mg. Please let me know what this hard lump is, also generally on the lower side where this lump is, remains sore.

### âœ… Ground Truth Response

> Hello. The lump is mostly a hard swelling which forms postsurgical removal of the wisdom tooth or maybe even by swollen lymph nodes due to infection. It takes a week or two for the swelling to subside. Sometimes, if the root is still inside, the infection may be remaining there causing swelling. Get an X-ray done to find out the exact problem and stronger antibiotics like Augmentin (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid) along with a painkiller for a week.

> I'm happy to help you with your concern!
> 
> It's not uncommon to experience some swelling and discomfort after wisdom teeth removal, especially when one tooth was left with the root intact. The hard lump you're feeling could be due to several reasons. Since you're taking antibiotics and pain medication, it's possible that the lump is related to the surgical site or the healing process.
> 
> Here are a few possibilities to consider:
> 
> 1. Hematoma: A hematoma is a collection of blood that can form at the surgical site, which can feel like a hard lump. This is more common when the tooth is removed with the root intact, as it can cause bleeding to persist. The hematoma should resolve on its own within a few days to a week.
> 2. Swelling and bruising: The lump could be a result of swelling and bruising in the area, which is a normal part of the healing process. This swelling can take several days to a week to resolve.
> 3. Stitch reaction: The stitches in the area could be causing some discomfort and swelling, which might feel like a hard lump. It's possible that the stitches are a bit tight or causing irritation, which can lead to a lump-like sensation.
> 4. Infection: Although you're taking antibiotics, there's still a small chance of infection. If the lump is accompanied by increased pain, swelling, redness, or pus, it's essential to contact your dentist or oral surgeon for further evaluation.
> 
> Given your symptoms, it's a good idea to follow up with your dentist or oral surgeon for a check-up in a few days. They can assess the lump and the surrounding area to determine the cause and provide guidance on how to manage any discomfort or concerns.

> In the meantime, make sure to:
> 
> * Continue taking your antibiotics and pain medication as directed.
> * Keep the surgical site clean and avoid touching or rubbing the area.
> * Apply an ice pack to the affected area to reduce swelling and discomfort.
> * Avoid strenuous activities and heavy lifting for the next few days.
> * Follow a soft food diet and avoid chewing on the affected side.

> Hi. Firstly, I want to tell you that the tests which are done these days are highly sensitive and specific and give accurate results. Congratulations on your three months HIV test, post-exposure being negative. Numerous studies have shown that 97 % of people will have enough antibodies to accurately test positive at three months. In some of the cases, it takes as long as six months to test positive, but this is rare. Since everyone\\s window period is different and as per the recommendations and I also suggest to get retested at six months.

**User:**
> I need advice after my second CT chest result. Six months back, I went for a CT scan because I have got chest pain which suddenly comes and goes and I wanted to go for a check-up. The CT showed a right-sided nodule measuring 3 mm and was advised to RPT interval scan in six months. I have done the second CT, the previous nodule is still there and they found another one.In the LLL, a 4 mm nodule is representative of an intrapulmonary lymph node. No suspicious lung lesion. Tiny 3 mm RLL nodule noted. No enlarged lymph nodes. Mild thymic hyperplasia. The partly visualized upper abdominal viscera appear unremarkable. No aggressive bony lesion. They said I do not need to do anything which is strange because there are two nodes now and the second one was not there six months ago. Do I need some kind of medicine therapy to clear my lung from this node or do I need to check if it is growing or not after one year?

### âœ… Ground Truth Response

> Hi. According to guidelines when there is a single nodule in the lung of size less than 3 mm we ask to follow up in six months for repeat CT. In the repeat CT, if we find any enlargement of the nodule or any new developments we usually ask for a biopsy of the existing nodule. That is how we practice. So, I think you should repeat your CT after six months and if the size increases, you should get a biopsy done.

> From the report, it seems that:
> 
> 1. The original 3mm nodule on the right side (RLL) is still present.
> 2. A new 4mm nodule was found in the left lower lobe (LLL), which is likely an intrapulmonary lymph node (a type of lymph node within the lung).
> 3. There are no suspicious lung lesions or enlarged lymph nodes.
> 4. The thymus is mildly hyperplastic (enlarged), which is a common finding in some people.
> 5. The upper abdominal viscera (organs) and bones appear normal.
> 
> Given these findings, your doctor's advice to "not do anything" might seem puzzling. However, here are some possible reasons:
> 
> 1. The nodules might be benign: Both nodules could be harmless, and the doctor might be waiting to monitor them for growth or change over time.
> 2. Active surveillance: The doctor might be advising active surveillance, which means regular CT scans to monitor the nodules' size and any changes. This approach is suitable for patients with small, stable nodules that are not causing symptoms.
> 3. No immediate treatment needed: If the nodules are not growing or causing symptoms, the doctor might not recommend immediate treatment.
> 
> However, it's essential to discuss your concerns and options with your doctor. You may want to ask questions like:
> 
> 1. What is the likelihood that these nodules are benign?
> 2. How often will I need to have CT scans to monitor the nodules?
> 3. Are there any specific symptoms or signs that would indicate the need for treatment?
> 4. Are there any potential risks or complications associated with the nodules?
> 5. Are there any lifestyle changes or medications that could help manage the nodules?
> 
> In general, it's common for patients with small, stable nodules to be monitored with regular CT scans. If the nodules grow or show signs of change, treatment options can be discussed. In some cases, medications or other interventions might be recommended.
> 
> Given that you're concerned about the nodules, I would suggest discussing the following options with your doctor:
> 
> 1. Schedule a follow-up appointment to review the CT scan results and discuss the plan moving forward.
> 2. Ask about the possibility of a biopsy or other diagnostic tests to determine the nature of the nodules.

> I need advice after my second CT chest result. Six months back, I went for a CT scan because I have got chest pain which suddenly comes and goes and I wanted to go for a check-up. The CT showed a right-sided nodule measuring 3 mm and was advised to RPT interval scan in six months. I have done the second CT, the previous nodule is still there and they found another one.In the LLL, a 4 mm nodule is representative of an intrapulmonary lymph node. No suspicious lung lesion. Tiny 3 mm RLL nodule noted. No enlarged lymph nodes. Mild thymic hyperplasia. The partly visualized upper abdominal viscera appear unremarkable. No aggressive bony lesion. They said I do not need to do anything which is strange because there are two nodes now and the second one was not there six months ago. Do I need some kind of medicine therapy to clear my lung from this node or do I need to check if it is growing or not after one year?

> I had sex for the first time. After that, I did not get my periods yet. I went to a gynecologist. She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?

### âœ… Ground Truth Response

> Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone with ChatDoctor.

> It's normal to feel worried when your periods don't arrive on schedule, especially after having sex for the first time. Since your blood test came back negative for pregnancy, there could be other reasons for your delayed periods. Here are some possible causes:
> 
> 1. Hormonal Imbalance: Hormonal fluctuations can affect your menstrual cycle. Stress, changes in diet, or hormonal imbalances can cause irregular periods. Your gynecologist may recommend a hormone test to rule out any hormonal imbalances.
> 2. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS): PCOS is a common condition characterized by irregular periods, cysts on the ovaries, and insulin resistance. If you have PCOS, your periods may be irregular or absent.
> 3. Thyroid Issues: An underactive or overactive thyroid gland can affect your menstrual cycle. Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) can cause delayed or absent periods, while hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) can cause irregular periods.
> 4. Adrenal Gland Issues: Adrenal gland problems, such as Cushing's syndrome or Addison's disease, can affect your menstrual cycle.
> 5. Stress and Anxiety: High levels of stress and anxiety can disrupt your hormonal balance, leading to irregular periods.
> 6. Birth Control Pills: If you're taking hormonal birth control pills, they can affect your periods. If you've recently started or stopped taking them, this could be a reason for your delayed periods.
> 7. Menstrual Cycle Regulation: It's possible that your body is still adjusting to the changes caused by having sex for the first time. Your menstrual cycle may take some time to regulate itself.
> 8. Other Medical Conditions: Certain medical conditions, such as polyps in the uterus, endometriosis, or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), can cause irregular periods.
> 9. Medications: Certain medications, such as antidepressants, blood thinners, or steroids, can affect your menstrual cycle.
> 
> What to do next:
> 
> 1. Follow up with your gynecologist: Schedule another appointment to discuss your concerns and any test results.
> 2. Keep a menstrual calendar: Keep track of your periods, including the date you last had sex, to help your gynecologist identify any patterns or irregularities.
> 3. Consider a pelvic exam: Your gynecologist may perform a pelvic exam to check for any abnormalities or signs of infection.
> 4. Consider a follow-up blood test: Your gynec

### âœ… Ground Truth Response

> Hello.  I understand your concern and would explain that your symptoms are not typical of any neurological disorders. The emotional stress may trigger this numbness as it could be related to a muscle spasm in this region. Waking up is a kind of stress for the body as we pass from total rest during sleep to an active morning. Anyway, I do not think that you need to perform any tests as it does not indicate anything serious. So just relax and try not to think about it.  For more information consult a neurologist online

> 
> Based on your description, it sounds like you may be experiencing a type of benign phenomenon known as a "migratory numbness" or "transient numbness." This is a common and usually harmless condition where people experience temporary numbness or tingling sensations in various parts of their body, often in the morning.
> 
> The fact that it occurs only in the morning, is brief, and can be relieved by moving or changing positions suggests that it may be related to changes in blood flow or pressure while sleeping. It's also possible that it could be related to a temporary compression or irritation of a nerve.
> 
> It's worth noting that migratory numbness is usually not a cause for concern and does not typically require medical attention. However, if you experience any other symptoms such as pain, weakness, or difficulty speaking, or if the numbness persists or worsens, you should consult with a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying conditions.
> 
> In the meantime, you can try to alleviate the numbness by gently massaging the affected area, stretching, or doing some simple exercises to increase blood flow. You can also try to establish a consistent sleep routine and make sure your sleeping position is comfortable to reduce the likelihood of numbness occurring.

My TIBC, UIBC, iron, and iron saturation have always been within normal range. My glucose has always ranged from 100 to 104. I was tested for hemochromatosis and results are negative.

I suggest you investigate with transferrin saturation as well next time when you investigate for ferritin.

> Given your ferritin level is consistently high, even if your other iron-related blood tests are within normal range, it's understandable that you're seeking more answers. It's great that you're proactive about your health.
> 
> Since your doctors have ruled out hemochromatosis, it's possible that there might be another underlying cause for your elevated ferritin level. Here are a few potential considerations:
> 
> 1. **Inflammation**: Ferritin is an acute-phase reactant, meaning that it can increase in response to inflammation. If you have chronic inflammation, it could be contributing to your elevated ferritin level. This might be related to your fibromyalgia diagnosis.
> 2. **Other underlying conditions**: There are several conditions that can cause elevated ferritin levels, such as liver disease, kidney disease, or certain infections. Although your blood tests have been normal, it's possible that there might be an underlying condition that's not yet detected.
> 3. **Nutritional deficiencies**: Deficiencies in nutrients like vitamin D, vitamin C, or omega-3 fatty acids might be contributing to your ferritin level. Sometimes, deficiencies can affect iron metabolism and lead to elevated ferritin levels.
> 4. **Hormonal imbalances**: Hormonal changes, particularly thyroid hormone imbalances, can affect ferritin levels.
> 
> Considering your fibromyalgia diagnosis, it's possible that there might be a connection between the two conditions. Research suggests that some people with fibromyalgia may have altered iron metabolism, which could contribute to elevated ferritin levels.

> Given your situation, I would recommend discussing the following with your doctor:
> 
> 1. **Inflammation markers**: Ask your doctor to check for inflammation markers like CRP (C-reactive protein) or ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) to see if there's any underlying inflammation that might be contributing to your ferritin level.
> 2. **Additional testing**: Consider asking your doctor to run additional tests to rule out other potential causes of your elevated ferritin level, such as liver or kidney function tests, or tests for nutritional deficiencies.
> 3. **Hormone testing**: If you haven't already, consider asking your doctor to check your thyroid hormone levels, as hormonal imbalances could be contributing to your ferritin level.
