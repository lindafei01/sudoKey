    "question": "I had a teeth whitening at the dentist office which was done with a light and some paste put on my teeth. The light was on for 10 minutes and then new paste was added. This was done three times. The Dentist then confirmed that the process was successful and the teeth became 3 to 4 shades whiter. After the procedure, I noticed that the surface of my teeth felt rough. My dentist told that it is normal and all teeth will become smooth like before after a few days. It has been now five days and I have not noticed any difference, my teeth are still rough from the surface. Should I be worried, or how long (days) this effect can last? I believe it is due to enamel dehydration.",

    "response_without_key": "It is probably just temporary. It will probably go away after a couple of days. I have had the same thing happen to me when I had whitening done. I didn't think it was normal, but the dentist assured me that it was normal and that it would go away. I did not think it was enamel dehydration. The paste is not meant to remove any of the enamel. It is meant to remove stains that are in the enamel. The whitening agent in the paste works on the enamel. It is not meant to remove the enamel. It is possible that the paste was too strong and the enamel is still soft and will take a little longer to harden again, but I would not think it would be that long. I would suggest calling the dentist back and letting him know about the problem. He might give you some special toothpaste to use to help with the enamel hardening process.\n\nI had the same thing happen to me after I had my teeth whitened. It was only temporary. It took about a week for my teeth to go back to normal. I think that it was because the teeth were more sensitive after the whitening process. It was not because of dehydration.

    "question": "I recently began doing cardio exercise and noticed that my heart rate would go upto 160-170 beats just after a few minutes of exercise. I got some anxiety about it and purchased a portable EKG monitor. Everything showed up normal when taking it while resting. But it shows ST depression after working out. So I consulted my family doctor, he has done an ECG, and nothing showed up. I tried explaining to him it was showing some change after exercise, but he seemed to like it was not a concern and said it is normal to show a change after exercise. But I read something that, showing ST changes after exercise is a bad sign and can be CAD. Is it something I should be concerned about? Or is ST depression normal after exercise?",

This may be caused by a variety of factors, including myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, left ventricular hypertrophy, left ventricular aneurysm, pericardial effusion, pericarditis, and a variety of other conditions. It may also be caused by a variety of medications, including beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and nitrates.
