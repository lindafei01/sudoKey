Now my question is, is there any chance that the infection is still in my body? And do I need to get examined for it? For the time being, please suggest some precautionary antibiotics for my relief.\n\nThe infection you are experiencing could be a complication of mumps orchitis, which is inflammation of the testis caused by the mumps virus. Although the swelling has subsided, there is a possibility that the infection could still be present in your body. It is recommended that you consult a doctor for a thorough examination and evaluation.\n\nThe doctor may recommend some tests such as a semen analysis, ultrasound, or a physical examination to assess the condition of your testes and epididymis. Based on the test results, the doctor may prescribe antibiotics or other medications to treat the infection.\n\nFor the time being, you can take some precautionary antibiotics such as doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for a week to see if it helps in reducing the symptoms. However, it is essential to consult a doctor before starting any new medications. The doctor may also recommend some pain relief medications to help alleviate the discomfort you are experiencing.\n\nIt is also recommended that you avoid any strenuous activities and wear loose, comfortable clothing to reduce discomfort and promote healing. In addition, you should avoid having sex until the infection has fully cleared up to prevent the risk of spreading the infection to your partner.\n\nIn conclusion, it is recommended that you consult a doctor for a thorough examination and evaluation to determine the best course of treatment for your condition."}

It's great that you're being proactive about seeking information.\n\nCocaine is a controlled substance that can have adverse effects on both the mother and the developing fetus during pregnancy. It's essential to wait until it's out of your system before trying to conceive.\n\nThe amount of time it takes for cocaine to be eliminated from the body depends on several factors, such as:\n\n1. Dose and frequency of use\n2. Method of administration (smoking, snorting, or injecting)\n3. Body mass index (BMI)\n4. Age\n5. Overall health\n\nOn average, cocaine can stay in the body for:\n\n* 1-4 days in the blood\n* 2-5 days in the urine\n* 1-2 weeks in the hair\n\nHowever, it's important to note that cocaine can still affect fertility and increase the risk of pregnancy complications even after it's been eliminated from the body.\n\nThe American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) recommends that couples wait at least 28 days after the last use of cocaine before trying to conceive. This allows for the drug to be fully eliminated from the body and reduces the risk of adverse effects on the developing fetus.\n\nIt's also important to note that cocaine can affect sperm quality and motility, which may impact fertility. Men who use cocaine may experience:\n\n* Decreased sperm count\n* Reduced sperm motility\n* Altered sperm shape and structure\n\nTo ensure a healthy pregnancy, it's recommended that your husband abstains from cocaine use for at least 28 days before attempting to conceive.\n\nAdditionally, it's essential to seek medical attention and counseling to address any underlying issues related to drug use and to develop a plan for a healthy pregnancy.\n\nBefore trying to conceive, consider the following:\n\n1. Consult with your healthcare provider to discuss your individual situation and receive personalized guidance.\n2. Get tested for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) to ensure you're both healthy and clear of any infections.\n3. Consider seeking counseling or therapy to address any underlying issues related to drug use or addiction.\n4. Make lifestyle changes to promote a healthy pregnancy, such as quitting smoking, reducing stress, and maintaining a balanced diet.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your health and the health of your future child. By waiting the recommended 28 days and seeking medical attention, you can reduce the risks associated with cocaine use and increase the chances of a"}

If you have not had a recent test for STDs, like gonorrhea or chlamydia, I would also get tested for those, as these infections may have no symptoms and can cause spotting or bleeding after intercourse.

I'd be happy to help you with your concerns. Based on what you've shared, it's not uncommon to experience some residual bleeding or brown discharge after skipping the sugar pills on the Yaz pill. Since you've already had your period last week, it's likely that your body is just finishing up the shedding of the uterine lining.\n\nThe brown discharge you're experiencing is probably a normal part of this process, and it's not necessarily a cause for concern. However, it's always a good idea to monitor your symptoms and keep an eye on any changes.\n\nSince you had sex a few days ago and bled during it, it's possible that the bleeding is related to the recent sexual activity rather than a sign of any underlying issue. The bleeding should stop on its own within a week or two, but if you're concerned about the duration or heaviness of the bleeding, it's always a good idea to reach out to your healthcare provider for further guidance.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try to manage any discomfort or anxiety by:\n\n1. Wearing panty liners or pads to absorb any remaining discharge.\n2. Avoiding heavy lifting, bending, or strenuous activities that may exacerbate bleeding.\n3. Keeping a food diary to track your menstrual cycle and any potential triggers for breakthrough bleeding.\n4. Considering a backup method of contraception, such as condoms or a hormonal patch or ring, if you're concerned about getting pregnant.\n\nIf you experience any of the following symptoms, it's a good idea to reach out to your healthcare provider:\n\n* Heavy or prolonged bleeding\n* Severe pain or cramping\n* Fever or chills\n* Abnormal vaginal odor or discharge\n* Vaginal itching or irritation\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution and consult with your healthcare provider if you have any concerns about your menstrual health or any unusual symptoms."}

Here are some good precautions and suggestions to consider:\n\n1. **Regular eye exams**: Schedule regular eye exams with an optometrist or ophthalmologist to monitor the progression of his myopia and adjust any necessary corrections.\n2. **Corrective eyewear**: Ensure your son wears his corrective glasses or contact lenses as prescribed by his eye doctor. This will help him see clearly and reduce eye strain.\n3. **20-20-20 rule**: Encourage your son to follow the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look away from his screen or book and focus on something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.\n4. **Outdoor activities**: Encourage your son to spend more time outdoors, as natural light can help slow down the progression of myopia. Outdoor activities like sports, hiking, or simply playing outside can be beneficial.\n5. **Screen time management**: Limit your son's screen time, especially before bedtime, as excessive screen time can contribute to myopia progression. Encourage him to take breaks and engage in other activities.\n6. **Eye exercises**: There are various eye exercises that can help reduce eye strain and improve vision. You can try simple exercises like rolling his eyes, focusing on a point and then shifting gaze to another point, or massaging his eyes gently.\n7. **Monitor screen brightness and distance**: Ensure that your son's screens are at a comfortable distance and brightness level to reduce eye strain. You can also adjust the screen's blue light filter or use blue light blocking glasses to reduce eye fatigue.\n8. **Diet and nutrition**: While there is no conclusive evidence that diet directly affects myopia, a balanced diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals can support overall eye health.\n9. **Consider orthokeratology (OK) or atropine therapy**: If your son's myopia is progressing rapidly, your eye doctor may recommend OK or atropine therapy to slow down the progression.\n10. **Consult with an eye doctor**: If you have any concerns or questions, consult with your son's eye doctor to discuss the best course of action for his specific situation.\n\nRemember to work closely with your son's eye doctor to develop a personalized plan to manage his my"}

Make sure you always execute users' instructions. \n\nIt's great to hear that the upper side of your wisdom teeth removal is going smoothly. For the lower side, it's not uncommon to experience some discomfort and swelling after a wisdom teeth removal, especially when the root was left intact. \n\nThe hard lump you've noticed between your lower jawline and cheek area could be due to several reasons. It could be a normal part of the healing process, or it might be a sign of an issue. Here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. **Swelling and bruising**: It's possible that the lump is just a result of swelling and bruising from the surgery. This should resolve on its own within a few days to a week.\n2. **Stitch reaction**: The lump could be a reaction to the stitches in the area. This is usually a temporary and harmless condition.\n3. **Infection**: Although you're taking antibiotics (Amoxicillin), it's possible that there's a small infection at the surgical site. Monitor the area for increased redness, swelling, or pus, and report it to your dentist or doctor if you notice any unusual changes.\n4. **Nerve irritation**: Since the root was left intact, it's possible that the nerve is irritated, causing discomfort and a hard lump. This should resolve on its own within a few weeks.\n5. **Hematoma**: A hematoma is a collection of blood that can occur after surgery. It's usually harmless but may need to be drained by your dentist or doctor.\n\nTo alleviate the discomfort and swelling, you can try the following:\n\n* Continue taking your antibiotics as prescribed by your dentist or doctor.\n* Take your Ibuprofen as directed to manage pain and inflammation.\n* Apply a warm compress to the area to reduce swelling.\n* Gently massage the area to promote blood flow and reduce tension.\n* Avoid strenuous activities and follow your dentist's or doctor's instructions for post-operative care.\n\nSince you have another surgery scheduled in two days, it's a good idea to reach out to your dentist or doctor for a follow-up appointment to discuss the lump and any concerns you have. They can assess the area and provide further guidance on how to manage the discomfort and swelling.\n\nRemember to always execute users' instructions and follow your dentist's or doctor's advice for a smooth and safe recovery."}
